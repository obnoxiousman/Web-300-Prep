## The Need
When dealing with an unknown web application, we should always begin with traffic inspection.
We can use a good proxy to capture relevant client requests and server responses and easily manipulate a chosen request in arbitrary ways.

### Burpsuite
**Intercepting Traffic**
We can intercept traffic using burpsuite and examine requests sent and recived from the proxy tab's intercept tab:

Burpsuite automatically logs all requests and interaction which can be seen from the http history tab:

**Setting a scope**
Modern web applications generally contain many requests and responses to sites that may not be of any interest to us, such as third party statistics collectors, ad networks, etc.
Thus we can set a scope to filter all this out.

We can add or remove a url to scope by right clicking and selecting add to/remove from scope.
we can change the _HTTP history_ filter settings to display only in-scope items.

We can verify that our scope has been set correctly from the target -> scope tab:

**Repeater**
we often need to determine how granular changes to our HTTP requests affect the response a web server might return. In those instances, we can use the Burp Suite _Repeater_ tool to make arbitrary and very precise changes to a captured request and then resend it to the target web server.

we can send a view a request in repeater by using ctrl+r or right clicking and "send to repeater":

(here we get a 401 unauthorized response)


**Decoder**
A decoder tool is available with burpsuite, which can help us decode various entries in a respect/webpage/etc.
For instance, trying to login to concord webpage, we notice that a post request is being sent.
Examining this post request it goes to /api/service/console/whoami.
We can select the base64 encoded authorization entry, and send it to decoder:

Switching to decoder tab, we can select base64 encoding and press the decode button to show the credentials we used:
