## Requests Function
The following python scritpt sends a request to a manage engine server at port 443 and extracts out various parts of the response:

The first few lines import the requests function and color function to make the ouput better looking.
The next line disables any certificate warnings that might disrupt our request.

The format_text function, takes an argument of a title and an item that will be present in the webpage and displays them in an orderly fashion.

Finally, the r variable stores the response of the request that is called by the requests.get method.

and the various print statements call our defined format_text function to display various parts of the response.

We can also work through a proxy by adding proxies=proxies argument in the requests.get method.
This will route the traffic through our defined burp suite proxy.
