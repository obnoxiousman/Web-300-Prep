## Introduction
OpenCRX is an open source customer relationship management (CRM) web application written in Java.
It suffers from a password reset vulnerability and an XXE(XML External Entity) vulnerability, that lets us get shell on the remote server.

The password reset tokens are deterministic and can be exploited, to gain authenticated access to the application.
Once authenticated, XXE can be used to gain remote code execution.

## Start of Analysis
We can start analyzing the source code in it's default configuration which runs on Apache TomEE.
We first need to understand the following:
1. Java web applications can be packaged in several different file formats, such as JARs, WARs, and EARs. All three of these file formats are essentially ZIP files with different extensions.
2. **Java Archive (JAR)** files are typically used for stand-alone applications or libraries.
3. **Web Application Archive (WAR)** files are used to collect multiple JARs and static content, such as HTML, into a single archive.
4. **Enterprise Application Archive (EAR)** files can contain multiple JARs and WARs to consolidate multiple web applications into a single file.

We can start the analysis by examining the opencrx-core-CRX.war file:

Extracting the EAR file, we find several WAR files.
Each WAR file is essentially a separate web application with its own static content.
All the common JAR files are in /APP-INF/lib.

We can start by examining the core file in jd-gui.
Exploring the contents of the WAR file in JD-GUI, we find several JSP files which mention authentication and password resets:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t6-ss2.png)

Since vulnerabilities in authentication and password reset functions can often be leveraged to gain authenticated access to a web application, we'll inspect these functions first:

```java
if(principalName != null && providerName != null && segmentName != null) {
			javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = org.opencrx.kernel.utils.Utils.getPersistenceManagerFactory();
			javax.jdo.PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager(
				SecurityKeys.ADMIN_PRINCIPAL + SecurityKeys.ID_SEPARATOR + segmentName, 
				null
			);
			try {
				org.opencrx.kernel.home1.jmi1.UserHome userHome = (org.opencrx.kernel.home1.jmi1.UserHome)pm.getObjectById(
					new Path("xri://@openmdx*org.opencrx.kernel.home1").getDescendant("provider", providerName, "segment", segmentName, "userHome", principalName)
				);
				pm.currentTransaction().begin();
				userHome.requestPasswordReset();
				pm.currentTransaction().commit();
				success = true;
			} catch(Exception e) {
				try {
					pm.currentTransaction().rollback();
				} catch(Exception ignore) {}
				success = false;
			}
		} else {
			success = false;
		}
	}
```

The code starts by evaluating an if statement, where principalName, providerName and segmentName cannot not be null.
These variables are then later on used by pm.getObjectById method call uses those values to get an org.opencrx.kernel.home1.jmi1.UserHome object.

The main line, calls the requestPasswordReset method on this object.
We will need to find where this class is defined to continue tracing the password reset logic.
The opencrx-kernel.jar file is located in the extracted /APP-INF/lib directory.
This directory contains all external libraries for the EAR file:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t6-ss3.png)

Here, we can find the UserHome class, based on the naming convention.
While we do find the class there, it is just an _interface_.
Interfaces define a list of methods but do not implement the actual code within those methods. Instead, classes can _implement_ one or more interfaces.
If a class implements an interface, it must include code for all the methods defined in that interface.

Searching further:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t6-ss4.png)

It seems that all implementation of interface classes, is under aop2 class.
Moreover, if the name of a class is appended with "Impl", it implements an interface.
We find the short method call:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t6-ss5.png)

We can click the requestPasswordReset function, and inspect it further:

```java
if (webAccessUrl != null) {

      String resetToken = Utils.getRandomBase62(40);
      
      String name = providerName + "/" + segmentName + " Password Reset";
      
      String resetConfirmUrl = webAccessUrl + (webAccessUrl.endsWith("/") ? "" : "/") + "PasswordResetConfirm.jsp?t=" + resetToken + "&p=" + providerName + "&s=" + segmentName + "&id=" + principalName;
      
      String resetCancelUrl = webAccessUrl + (webAccessUrl.endsWith("/") ? "" : "/") + "PasswordResetCancel.jsp?t=" + resetToken + "&p=" + providerName + "&s=" + segmentName + "&id=" + principalName;
      
      String description = getRequestPasswordResetNotificationTemplate(userHome);
      description = description.replace("{RESET_CONFIRM_URL}", resetConfirmUrl);
      
      description = description.replace("{RESET_CANCEL_URL}", resetCancelUrl);
      
      Base.getInstance().sendAlert((ContextCapable)userHome, principalName, name, description, (short)2, Integer.valueOf(0), null);
	      
      SysLog.warning("Password reset request", Arrays.asList(new String[] {resetConfirmUrl, resetCancelUrl }));
      
      changePassword((Password)loginPrincipal
          .getCredential(), (String)null, "{RESET}" + resetToken);
```

The application makes a method call to generate a token.
The token is used in some strings like resetConfirmUrl and resetCancelUrl and ultimately passed to the changePassword method.

Now, clicking on the getRandomBase62 method, of the Utils class, lead us to the method definition, which is as follows:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t6-ss6.png)

The getRandomBase62 method accepts an integer value and returns a randomly generated string of that length.
However, there's something interesting here.
