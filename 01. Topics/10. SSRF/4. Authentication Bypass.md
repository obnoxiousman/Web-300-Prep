## Render Endpoint

We discovered the /render endpoint, during our initial enumeration.
However, we realized that accessing the service, requires authentication via the API gateway.
Now that we have discovered the SSRF, we can use it to access the parts of the service, without authenticating, and call the render service without authentication.

To do this, we first need to figure out what server, is hosting the render service.
It does not seem like the render service is running on the Directus host.
We can safely direct our attention to the unknown service we found on port 9000 while doing host enumeration. We can do that with a curl request:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss21.png)

The request failed to find a valid resource.
This could be because the url of the backend service might not match the URL of the API gateway that is exposed.
For example, the backend URL could include versioning such as:

```url
/v1/render
/api/render/
/v1/api/render/
/api/v1/render
```

Running through these possible URLs, we hit a successful one:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss22.png)

The error is different with /api/render, but we still cannot access due to a 400 error, meaning the request, lacks some content.
To fill in the content, we can fuzz the parameter that is being asked by the request such as:

```url
/render?data=somedata
/render?file=file
/render/url=http://url:port/resource
/render/input=somedata
/render/target=http://url:port/resource
```

Running these through the curl request, we find a good target:

We see that we are able to access the render service, and get a callback on our apache server.
We see the headless chrome made the request.
Headless chrome is basically chrome but without any UI.
