## Enumeration

We can start our enumeration with an HTTP request to the API gateway server with curl:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss1.png)

The server responds with a 404 status, and includes the server header i.e. Kong 2.2.1.
This means that we're dealing with the Kong api gateway version 2.2.1

The documentation says that the admin API for this gateway, runs on port 8001, however, connection to that port is refused:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss2.png)

As we don't have many options, we can start by running Gobuster on our target, and viewing what endpoints we can work with. We use the following commands:
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://apigateway:8000 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt -s "200,204,301,302,307,401,403,405,500"
```

Running Gobuster we see the following results:
```ls
files2
files_and_dirs
filescan
filescavban
filescavenger-803-404384
filescavenger-803-406688
filescavenger-811-421200

render_outline_to_html
renderplain
render
usersamples
userscience
userscripts
usersdomains
usersguide
users-ironpython
users_watchdog
```

To see responses of all these endpoints, we can run them through burp and catch the responses.
Next, we can sort the responses by status code, thus we will be able to work with unique status codes first, and leave the generic/expected one's for later:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss3.png)

The 4 responses that returned a 401 response, are pretty much identical.

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss4.png)

Based on the /render URL paths prefix and the response body content, the API gateway might be routing these four requests to the same backend service named "render".
All four responses included a _WWW-Authenticate_ header with a value of **Key realm="Kong"**, which means we will likely need some kind of API key to call this service.

Moving on, the responses for URL paths prefixed with /users and /files are very similar.

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss5.png)

We notice the _X-Powered-By_ header with the "Directus" value and an error message: 'You don't have permission to access the "directus_files" collection'.

The response for URL paths starting with /users generates a slightly different error message (referencing the "directus_users" collection), but are otherwise identical.

Based on the _X-Powered-By_ server header, we are dealing with a _Directus_ application.
A quick google search reveals that it is an instant app an API for SQL database.
From our initial list of 29 URLs, we seem to have three distinct endpoints: _files_, _users_, and _render_. Let's save these three endpoints in a new file named endpoints_simple.txt.

## Verb Tampering

We can identify more endpoints, by using different verbs/actions/identifiers for the same object, and analyzing the response.
This would help us identify what URLs do not require authentication, and how we can deal with them, and use them to potentially exploit the misconfiguration.

APIs also respond differently based on the method of the request.
A GET request to /auth might return a 404 not found or a 405 method not allowed status code, however a POST request to the same endpoint, may return a 200 OK or a 401 unauthorized.
This means, to black box test an API, we need to configure our custom python script, that will not only send only GET or POST requests, but will send both requests, or any other type we specify such as PUT, OPTIONS, DELETE, etc.

Our script will look as follows:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

##import modules##
import argparse
import requests

##set arguments##
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('-a','--actionlist', help='actionlist to use')
parser.add_argument('-t','--target', help='host/ip to target', required=True)
parser.add_argument('-w','--wordlist', help='wordlist to use')
args = parser.parse_args()

##create a list called actions##
actions = []

##iterate through verbs given as the actionlist##
with open(args.actionlist, "r") as a:
    for line in a:
	    ##append the verbs to actions list##
        try:
            actions.append(line.strip())
        except:
            print("Exception occurred")

##print the header##
print("Path \t\t - \tGet\tPost")

##read the wordlist file##
with open(args.wordlist, "r") as f:
	##iterate through words in the file##
	for word in f:
		##iterate through the verb in actions list##
        for action in actions:
	        ##print the word with the verb being used in formatted way##
            print('\r/{word}/{action}'.format(word=word.strip(), action=action), end='')
            ##format the URL to send##
            url = "{target}/{word}/{action}".format(target=args.target, word=word.strip(), action=action)
            ##make a get request##
            r_get = requests.get(url=url).status_code
            ##make a post request##
            r_post = requests.post(url=url).status_code
			##if response code is not 204,401,403 or 404, print out the endpoint##
            if(r_get not in [204,401,403,404] or r_post not in [204,401,403,404]):
                print('                    \r', end='')
                print("/{word}/{action:10} - \t{get}\t{post}".format(word=word.strip(), action=action, get=r_get, post=r_post))

##finish the script##
print('\r', end='')
print("Wordlist complete. Goodbye.")
```

With the script complete, we will use a dirb's wordlist as our verbs, and the 3 endpoints we found, as the wordlist.
We can now run the script:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss6.png)

Running the script, we see some endpoints, that give 200 status code. However, they are not very interesting.
Other than that, we receive a 403 on import for files object and an invite for users object.

Crafting a custom curl request, we see:

![](../../03.%20Images/t9-ss7.png)

We seem to have found an API endpoint that we can interact with (even though we have not authenticated) and it provides usage information.
Any time we discover an API or web form that includes a _url_ parameter, we always want to check it for a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability.
