## Headers

When we discover a target application that serves CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) headers, we should investigate them since overly-permissive headers could create a vulnerability.

For instance, we could create a payload on a malicious website that could force a visitor to request data from the vulnerable website.
If the victim is authenticated to the target site, our malicious site could steal the user's data from the target site or run malicious requests (depending on the CORS settings).
This attack is considered a form of _Cross-Site Request Forgery_ (CSRF) or session riding (Something we saw in the previous module).

## Same-Origin Policy(SOP)

Browsers enforce a same-origin policy to prevent one origin from accessing resources on a different origin.
An origin is defined as a protocol, hostname, and port number.
A resource can be an image, html, data, json, etc.

Taking the example of the site a.com, with the endpoint "/latest", here is a table that explains whether or not resources will load or not, from the given sources:

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss4.png)

The purpose of SOP is not to prevent the request for a resource from being sent, but to prevent JavaScript from reading the response.
In the table, all of the requests would be sent, but the JavaScript on https://a.com/latest would not be able to read the response of those marked as "Blocked".

Images, iFrames, and other resources are allowed because the SOP doesn't allow the JavaScript engine to access the contents of a response, however, it does allow the resource to be loaded onto the page.

This can be further explained by interacting with the JavaScript console. We will first fetch the cfg.js file that belongs to the same concord server:

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss5.png)

We see that the request was made, and the contents are fetched, and accessible by JavaScript.
However, if we make the same request to a some random website, this will not be the case:

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss6.png)

It may look like the request was blocked, but looking at burpsuite session:

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss7.png)

This shows us that even though the request was made, and the content was fetched, the browser, prevented us from accessing the JavaScript.

Even though this is a security feature to keep the user's safe, it can be problematic for developers as well, as if a developer wants to load the contents of (for instance), api.a.com to a.com(a single page web application). The JavaScript will be prevented from being accessed, and the page will not load.

To solve this caveat, CORS, was introduced.
CORS allows developers to ease the SOP, and load the contents from different origins.

## What is CORS?

In its simplest terms, CORS instructs a browser, via headers, which origins are allowed to access resources from the server.
In light of our previous example, using CORS, the single page web application a.com will be able to load contents from api.a.com.

An example of CORS headers for a.com is following:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://a.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: cache-control,content-language,expires,last-modified,content-range,content-length,accept-ranges
Cache-Control: no-cache
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Connection: close
Content-Length: 15

{"status":"ok"}
```

The CORS headers start with "Access-Control". While not all of them are necessary for cross-origin communication, this example displays some common CORS headers.
-   **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: Describes which origins can access the response.
-   **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**: Indicates if the request can include credentials (cookies)
-   **Access-Control-Expose-Headers**: Instructs the browser to expose certain headers to JavaScript

However, the most important of these headers is the Access-Control-Allow-Origin, which specifies that the origin at https://a.com can access the resources on this host.

## Preflight Requests

We know that the SOP does not prevent the requests from being sent, but blocks the browser from accessing the JavaScript.
However, there are exceptions.

Some requests, require a preflight request, sent with the OPTIONS method.
These are requests which determines if the subsequent browser request should be allowed to be sent or not. Requests such as one with custom HTTP headers, or POST requests with  non standard content-types, require a preflight request.

To understand this better, we will again interact with the JavaScript console.
We will first send a POST request to example.com:

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss8.png)

As expected, it gets blocked, and of course, if we inspect burp, we'll find that only 1 POST request was sent, and the JavaScript was prevented from being accessed by the browser.

However, if we now change up the content type to something that is not standard such as "application/json", again, the request is blocked, however, inspecting burp:

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss9.png)

We see that the OPTIONS request was sent.
In this request the client (the browser) is attempting to send a POST request with a custom content-type header. Since the server did not respond with CORS headers, the SOP blocked the request.

For our final test, we will send a POST request to a URL, that will respond to the OPTIONS request, with the CORS headers.

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss10.png)

We see that the request does not error out.
Further on, inspecting burp, we see:

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss11.png)

1. The initial OPTIONS request is sent, indicating that we're trying to send a POST request with custom content-type.
2. This time the response contained several CORS headers which allows our origin, allows our custom header, allows a POST request, instructs our browser to cache the CORS configuration for 0 seconds, and allows credentials (cookies).
3. Following this preflight request, we find the actual POST request we were attempting to send.
4. Finally, the request was sent with the custom content-type.

From a security perspective, the most important headers when analyzing target applications for CORS vulnerabilities are _Access-Control-Allow-Origin_ and _Access-Control-Allow-Credentials_.

**Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**
The default for this header is "false".
If this header is set to true, any request sent will include the cookies set by the site.
This means that the browser will automatically authenticate the request.

**Access-Control-Allow-Origin**
This header can be set to three values: "*", an origin, or "null".
If the header is set to a wildcard ("*"), all origins are allowed to read a resource from the remote server.
This might seem like the vulnerable configuration we are looking for, but this setting requires that _Access-Control-Allow-Credentials_ is set to false, which results in all requests being unauthenticated.
If the header is set to an origin value, only that origin is allowed to read the resource and, if _Access-Control-Allow-Credentials_ is set to true, include the cookies.

In secure circumstances, the _Access-Control-Allow-Origin_ would only be set to trusted origins. This means that a malicious site we control would not be able to make HTTP requests on behalf of a user and read the response.

Unfortunately, _Access-Control-Allow-Origin_ only lets sites set a single origin.
For this reason, developers found a creative (and insecure) solution.
By dynamically setting the _Access-Control-Allow-Origin_ header to the origin of the request, multiple origins can send requests with Cookies.

We can see this example in our test application:

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss12.png)

The value in the _Origin_ header is set to the origin in the browser "http://concord:8001".
This header is automatically set by the browser for all CORS requests sent by JavaScript.
The response contains this origin in the _Access-Control-Allow-Origin_ header and allows for cookies to be sent with the request.
This is the mechanism that instructs the CORS test site to allow requests (with cookies) from any origin.

We can do one final test by sending the request to repeater, and then changing our origin browser to something.com, and we see that the response headers, change accordingly.

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss13.png)

## Returning To Concord

If we go back to the interesting whoami request, we notice that there are no origin headers to work with, however, the CORS headers in response are set to "\*" :

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss14.png)

By this, we understand that:
1. This origin would indicate, that the browser, won't send the cookies on cross-origin requests.
2. If the application is using authentication, there must be some form of session management.
3. This in-turn would mean, that there's some way to send the session identifier with the request.

We will proceed to add the origin header, and see what we get as a response.
Adding the origin as "something.com", we see this in the response:

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss15.png)

Not only did the server replicate the origin into the _Access-Control-Allow-Origin_ header, but it also added the _Access-Control-Allow-Credentials_ header, setting it to true.

However, every endpoint and HTTP method can have different CORS headers depending on the actions that are allowed or disallowed.
Since we know that all non-standard GET and POST requests will send an OPTIONS request first to check if it can send the subsequent request, let's change the method to OPTIONS and review the response.

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss16.png)

In this case, the CORS headers, are note replicated.
Unfortunately, this means that the CORS vulnerability is limited.
We will only be able to read the response of GET requests and standard POST requests.

## SameSite Attribute

**Why is this important?**
Well, to understand what we can and can't extract, we need to understand what the SameSite attribute is, and how is it important to us.

Fact is, it is not difficult to instruct the user's browser to send the request.
what difficult is, is to instruct the  browser to send the request with the session cookies and gain access to the response.
To understand the mechanics of cookies in this context, we must discuss the optional _SameSite_ attribute of the "Set-Cookie" HTTP header.

The SameSite cookie attribute, is an attribute, to the Set-Cookie header.
This attribute can have 3 possible values:
1. Strict
2. None
3. Lax

**Strict**
When the SameSite attribute is set to "Strict", the cookies are only sent, when the user is on the corresponding website.

For instance, a website called cat.com:
1. We login to cat.com, and it gives us some cookies, to decide which cat to show us.
2. The cookies sent to us, has the SameSite attribute, set to "Strict". This would mean multiple things.
3. Our browser will not send the cookies to any other site except cat.com, even if the resource from cat.com is embedded into a different website.
4. Cookies won't be sent on navigation actions either, meaning clicking a link to cat.com from something.com won't send the cookies either.

**None**
When _SameSite_ is set to _None_, cookies will be sent in all contexts: when navigating, when loading images, and when loading iFrames. The _None_ value requires the "Secure" attribute, which ensures the cookie is only sent via HTTPS.

**Lax**
If the value is set to "Lax", it will instruct the browser, that the cookies will be sent on some requests across different sites.
For the cookie to be included in the request, it will have to match the following criteria:
1.  It must use a method that does not facilitate a change on the server (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS).
2.  It must originate from user-initiated navigation (also known as top-level navigation), for example, clicking a link will include the cookie, but requests made by images or scripts will not.

SameSite is a new concept, and by default(meaning no implementation of the header) most browser in old days would have it set to "None".
New browsers have it set to "Lax".

## Implementation

Now that we've understood how this works, we can now look for what type of attributes does our victim web application uses.
To find this, we can start by making a random authentication request, and see what kind of cookies and attributes are given in the response:

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss17.png)

When we try to login, the authentication goes in as base64 encoded, as a part of the "Authorization" header.
Studying the response, we notice that there's no SameSite attribute in the "Set-Cookie" header, meaning we can assume that concord does not set this attribute, and the default one will be used.

This means, if our victim, is using a browser who does not deal with cookies, or sets it to "none" by default, they're most likely vulnerable to CSRF.

## Mitigations and Problems

To deal with issues of CSRF, in hopes of making it obsolete, developers came up with the idea of CSRF tokens.
These tokens must be sent with a request that processes a state change.
The CSRF token would indicate that a user loaded a page and submitted the request themselves.

However, CSRF tokens are incorrectly configured, reused, or not rotated frequently enough.
Making even them, bypass-able.
Moreover, if the site has insecure CORS options set, we can even extract the CSRF tokens, and use them by embedding them in the forged request.
