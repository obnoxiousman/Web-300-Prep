## Continuous Deployment Servers(CDS)

Given the complexity of modern web applications, modern development teams rely on automated deployment practices that streamline the application build, testing, and deployment process.
This practice enhances the speed, agility and accuracy of the deployment process.

However, since the workflow servers at the heart of this environment must be granted access to code in the Dev, QA, and Production environments, they are prime targets for attack.

Concord is one such workflow server, which was developed by Walmart.
This section, will have a grey box approach, where we will have the documentation of the server, but not it's source code.

## Getting Started

We start by analyzing the application, and run across a login page:

We can run dirb(directory buster) in background, and see what requests are being made, as we load the page through burp:

![](../../03.%20Images/t8-ss2.png)

We see some libraries, images, etc. being loaded.
But one particularly interesting request is the /api/service/console/whoami as it is a system command.

Reading the response, and noticing the headers, we see something interesting:
