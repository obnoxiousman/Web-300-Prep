## Other Paths

Due to CSRF starting to get extremely obsolete, due to a multitude of patches, such as CSRF tokens, more secure browsers, secure default configurations etc.
It is unrealistic to find a remote code execution chained from CSRF.
Thankfully, there's more vulnerabilities in concord that lead to authentication bypass.

We can download the source code using rsync, to our local machine.
We will also stop the old version, and start the new version of concord, from the machine:

```sh
rsync -az student@concord:/home/student/concord-1.83.0/ concord/ #copy source code
sudo docker-compose -f concord-1.43.0/docker-compose.yml down #stop old version
sudo docker-compose -f concord-1.83.0/docker-compose.yml up -d #start new version
```

We can start our audit, by reviewing the source code.
We will start by reviewing how the application is booted and installed. This process starts with the start.sh file, which references to the "server/dist/src/assembly/" folder.

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss25.png)

While reviewing this file, we find that the application will run the class defined in the MAIN_CLASS variable.
This variable can be set to either the Main class in com.walmartlabs.concord.server.dist or MigrateDb class in com.walmartlabs.concord.server.
Database migrations are used to initialize the application or update the applications database to the current version.
They can also be used to insert, create or change data.

Reviewing migrations is a good habit, as it helps to understand the database layout, and in some cases might even reveal sensitive data.

Thus, we can look for MigrateDb, in the code base, with the following command:

```bash
grep -r "MigrateDB" ./ 
# result : 
#./server/dist/src/assembly/start.sh:    MAIN_CLASS="com.walmartlabs.concord.server.MigrateDB"
#./server/impl/src/main/java/com/walmartlabs/concord/server/MigrateDB.java:public class #MigrateDB {
#./server/impl/src/main/java/com/walmartlabs/concord/server/MigrateDB.java:                        #new SpaceModule(new URLClassSpace(MigrateDB.class.getClassLoader()), BeanScanning.CACHE),
#./server/impl/src/main/java/com/walmartlabs/concord/server/MigrateDB.java:        new #MigrateDB().run(injector);
```

Apart from the start.sh file, another java file pops up where the MigrateDb class is declared:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss26.png)

After reviewing this file, we find one of the classes referenced is DatabaseModule.
This is interesting as by it's name, it aims to the fact that it's used in database management. Looking at it's import function, we can deduce the location of the declaration i.e. "server/db/src/main/java/com/walmartlabs/concord/db".
We will navigate to the root of the folder.
Running the tree command on the root folder we find:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss27.png)

The java folder, contains the main code.
Whereas, the resources folder, contains the XML documents, with a file named liquidbase.xml

To understand what that is, we can simply do a google search:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss28.png)

These must be the database migrations that include definitions for table names, columns, and data.
We can review the other version files, to check the format.

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss29.png)

We see various tables being created, such as the users table, that has the email and the username of the admin.
Looking further, we find the section for API keys, and find a key:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss30.png)

As we've found the API key, we can use the API, to authenticate to the application, and get the RCE as we did before.
So, we use a curl command to authenticate:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss31.png)

The curl request is successful, however, we get a 401 unauthorized status, meaning the API key might have been changed.
The migration is also the first one, and thus it gives good reason that it might have been changed.
So, we can go ahead and grep for all similar migrations:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss32.png)

We find 3 files with similar keys. reading the files:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t8-ss33.png)

We again, find the API key, and using this key, we are able to authenticate to the API:
