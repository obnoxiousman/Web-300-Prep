## Discovering the Application
In order to discover exposed endpoints, we'll first visit the application home page and observe the additional endpoints that the application reaches out to in order to generate the page.
While it might be tempting to ignore directories that contain images, CSS, and JavaScript, they might leave clues as to how the application works.

To begin, we will fire up burp, and create a basic sitemap.
The initial connection reveals the following points:
1. The openITCOCKPIT application runs on HTTPS. We were redirected when the page was loaded.
2. Since we do not have a valid session, openITCOCKPIT redirected the application root to /login/login.
3. The application uses Bootstrap, jQuery, particles, and Font Awesome.
4. The vendor dependencies are stored in the lib and vendor directories.
5. Application-specific JavaScript appears located in the js directory.

The sitemap with the default /login/login page looks as follows:

Visiting a non existent page, such as /doesnotexist will load more of the site and map in our burp:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss2.png)

The /js/vendor/UUID.js-4.0.3/ directory contains a dist subdirectory.
When a JavaScript library is successfully built, the output files are typically written to a dist (or public) subdirectory.
During the build process, the necessary files are typically minified, unnecessary files removed, and the resulting .js library can be distributed and ultimately imported into an application.

However, the existence of a dist directory suggests that the application developer included the entire directory instead of just the .js library file. Any unnecessary files in this directory could expand our attack surface.

Looking up UUID.js-4.0.3 we find a website for the page for the library.
Going to the homepage leads us to a GitHub [link](https://github.com/LiosK/UUID.js).

The _uuidjs_ GitHub repo includes a root-level dist directory.
At this point, we know that the developers of openITCOCKPIT have copied at least a part of this library's repo directory into their application. They may have copied other files or directories as well.

Keeping that in mind, visiting  /js/vendor/UUID.js-4.0.3/README.md, gives us the same readme file as in the GitHub repo.
Although the application is misconfigured to serve more files than necessary, this is only a minor vulnerability considering our goal of remote command execution. We are, however, expanding our view of the application's internal structure.

Server-side executable files (such as .php) are rarely included in vendor libraries, meaning this may not be the best location to begin hunting for SQL injection or RCE vulnerabilities.

However, the libraries may contain HTML files that could introduce reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Since these "extra files" are typically less-scrutinized than other deliberately-exposed files and endpoints, we should investigate further.

## Targeted Discovery
We know that 5 libraries exist in the application:
- UUID.js-4.0.3
- fineuploader
- gauge
- gridstack
- lodash

To find more libraries that might not have been listed,  we could bruteforce the vendor directory with a tool like Gobuster.
To create a list of vendor directories, we'll refer to the nice-registry repo from GitHub, that contains a curated list of all npm packages.
We'll use the following commands to create the list:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nice-registry/all-the-package-names/bba7ca95cf29a6ae66a6617006c8707aa2658028/names.json

jq '.[0:10000]' names.json | grep ","| cut -d'"' -f 2 > npm-10000.txt
```

And the following Gobuster command, to run a directory bruteforce:

```sh
gobuster dir -w ./npm-10000.txt -u https://openitcockpit/js/vendor/ -k
```

We get the following result:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss4.png)

The Gobuster search revealed the additional "bootstrap-daterangepicker" package.
While the UUID.js package we discovered earlier contained the version in the name of the directory, the other vendor libraries do not.
For this reason, we will bruteforce the files in all the library directories to attempt to discovering the library version.

We will create a packages.txt file with the following contents:

```urls
https://openitcockpit/js/vendor/fineuploader
https://openitcockpit/js/vendor/gauge
https://openitcockpit/js/vendor/gridstack
https://openitcockpit/js/vendor/lodash
https://openitcockpit/js/vendor/UUID.js-4.0.3
https://openitcockpit/js/vendor/bootstrap-daterangepicker
```

The wordlist must include common file names like README.md, which might contain a version number of the library.
For this we will use seclists, quickhits.txt file.

Our command will look like so:

```sh
while read l; do echo "===$l==="; gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/quickhits.txt -k -q -u $l; done < packages.txt
```

Gobuster did not discover any directories or files for the fineuploader or gauge libraries, but it discovered a README.md under gridstack, lodash, UUID.js-4.0.3, and bootstrap-daterangepicker.

We will update our packages.txt and change it to the following:

```urls
https://openitcockpit/js/vendor/gridstack
https://openitcockpit/js/vendor/lodash
https://openitcockpit/js/vendor/bootstrap-daterangepicker
```

And run a curl command, with a while loop to get the contents of the readme.md files:

```sh
while read l; do echo "===$l==="; curl $l/README.md -k; done < packages.txt
```

Running the command, we see that these are the versions for the libraries:
- UUID - 4.0.3.
- Lodash - 3.9.3
- Gridstack - 0.2.3

With these versions, we can now move on to downloading the repositories, on to our attacker machine and analyze the source code.
After unzipping all the files, we can proceed to look for all HTML files:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss5.png)

Now that we have a list of HTML files, we can search for an XSS vulnerability to exploit.
Since these HTML files are not dynamically generated by a server, traditional reflected XSS and stored XSS won't work since user-supplied data cannot be appended to the HTML files.
However, these files might contain additional JavaScript that allows user input to manipulate the DOM, which could lead to DOM-based XSS.
