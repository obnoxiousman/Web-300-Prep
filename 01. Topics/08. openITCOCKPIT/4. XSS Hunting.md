## Looking for XSS
We can start our XSS hunting DOM based XSS by searching references to the document object.
We can start by searching for the "document.write".
We will also use the --include flag for grep, to limit our search to html files:

The results of this search reveal four unique files that write directly to the _document_. We also find interesting keywords like "urlParams" in the _ui_ object that potentially point to the use of user-provided data.

We can start inspecting these files.
We start by inspecting the lodash/perf/index.html file:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss10.png)

Going through the code we notice the use of the _document.write_ function to load a script on the web page.
The source of the script is set to the _ui.otherPath_ and _ui.buildPath_ variable.

We can look for these variables and see if we can control them with the following regex:

```sh
grep -r "buildPath[[:space:]]*=" ./
```

We get the following result:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss11.png)

The search reveals two files: asset/perf-ui.js and asset/test-ui.js.
Analyzing perf-ui.js file and navigating to the section where _buildPath_ is set:

```javascript
var build = (build = /build=([^&]+)/.exec(location.search)) && decodeURIComponent(build[1]);
```

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss12.png)

The _ui.buildPath_ is set near the bottom of the file.
A _switch_ returns the value of the _build_ variable by default if no other condition is true.
The _build_ variable is set near the beginning of the file and is obtained from _location.search_ (the query string) and the value of the query string is parsed using regex.
The regex looks for "build=" in the query string and extracts the value.
There seems to be no sanitization for the "build" query parameter which means it is most likely vulnerable to XSS.

We can, test the xss, by hosting the library on a local port, and injecting our payload.
We host the library, and view the page source:

Inserting a DOM manipulating payload to get xss, we get the following:

Our target is xss vulnerable.
