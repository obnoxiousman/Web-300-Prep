## Sorting Content
With the contents retrieved from the session riding XSS, we have the contents of an authenticated section.
We can now move on to inspecting these contents, and identifying any vulnerabilities for remote code execution.

We can start by looking at the files, and see if we find something interesting:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss26.png)

The most interesting files seem to be:
1. commands.html
2. cronjobs.html
3. serviceescalations.html

Reading the contents of commands.html, we find something interesting:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss27.png)

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss28.png)

We find an object named appData, which contains 2 interesting variables.
1. akey : defined with an alpha numeric value
2. websocket_url : ends with sudo_server

The combination of a _commands_ route and _sudo_server_ WebSocket connection endpoint piques our interest.
Looking up the term WebSocket, we find that, a _WebSocket_ is a browser-supported communication protocol that uses HTTP for the initial connection but then creates a full-duplex connection, allowing for fast communication between the client and server
While HTTP is a stateless protocol, WebSocket is stateful.

In a properly-built solution, the initial HTTP connection would authenticate the user and each subsequent WebSocket request would not require authentication.
However, due to complexities many developers face when programming with the WebSocket protocol, they often put in their own authentication in the front end.
We see a similar case in our victim.

In a browser-based application, WebSocket connections are initiated via JavaScript.
Since JavaScript is not compiled, the source defining the WebSocket connection must be located in one of the JavaScript files loaded on this page.
Thus to understand, to find the source of the WebSocket, we will look for all the referenced JavaScript files inside the source code:
```bash
cat commands.html | grep -E "script.*src" | grep -Ev "vendor|lib|plugin" | grep -v "smartadmin"
#some more cleaning up
```

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss29.png)

After identifying the files, we need to understand that js files are mostly never under authentication.
This means that we can access these files in a regular, unauthenticated session, and download their front end code:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss30.png)

With the files now downloaded, we can start looking for the definition of the WebSocket.
However, before that, the downloaded JavaScript code, is hard to read, and not formatted, and compressed, we can solve this by using jsbeutifier, or use vs code:

```bash
for f in compressed_*.js; do js-beautify $f > prettycode/"${f//compressed_}"; done;
```

Now that we have a readable version of the custom JavaScript, we can begin reviewing the files.

## Understanding WebSocket

WebSocket communication can be initiated with JavaScript by running:

```javascript
new WebSocket
```

We can start our search by looking for anywhere in JavaScript files, where "WebSocket" or "Websocket" is mentioned.
Using grep, we stumble upon the first result of components.js file, where the component named "WebsocketSudoComponent" is defined,  inside which the functions used to send messages, parse response, and manage the data coming in and going out are defined:

```JavaScript
App.Components.WebsocketSudoComponent = Frontend.Component.extend({
    _wsUrl: null,
    _key: null,
    _connection: null,
    _callback: function(e) {},
    _errorCallback: function() {},
    _success: function(e) {},
    _dispatcher: function(transmitted) {},
    _event: function(transmitted) {},
    _uniqid: null,
    _keepAliveIntervalObject: null,
    _keepAliveInterval: 30000,
    setup: function(wsURL, key) {
        this._wsUrl = wsURL;
        this._key = key
    },
    connect: function() {
        if (this._connection === null) {
            this._connection = new WebSocket(this._wsUrl)
        }
        this._connection.onopen = this._onConnectionOpen.bind(this);
        this._connection.onmessage = this._onResponse.bind(this);
        this._connection.onerror = this._onError.bind(this);
        return this._connection
    },
    send: function(json, connection) {
        connection = connection || this._connection;
        connection.send(json)
    },
    _onConnectionOpen: function(e) {
        this.requestUniqId()
    },
    _onError: function() {
        this._errorCallback()
    },
    _onResponse: function(e) {
        var transmitted = JSON.parse(e.data);
        switch (transmitted.type) {
            case 'connection':
                this._uniqid = transmitted.uniqid;
                this.__success(e);
                break;
            case 'response':
                if (this._uniqid === transmitted.uniqid) {
                    this._callback(transmitted)
                }
                break;
            case 'dispatcher':
                this._dispatcher(transmitted);
                break;
            case 'event':
                if (this._uniqid === transmitted.uniqid) {
                    this._event(transmitted)
                }
                break;
            case 'keepAlive':
                break
        }
    },
    requestUniqId: function() {
        this.send(this.toJson('requestUniqId', ''))
    },
    toJson: function(task, data) {
        var jsonArr = [];
        jsonArr = JSON.stringify({
            task: task,
            data: data,
            uniqid: this._uniqid,
            key: this._key
        });
        return jsonArr
    },
    keepAlive: function() {
        if (this._keepAliveIntervalObject == null) {
            this._keepAliveIntervalObject = setInterval(function() {
                this.send(this.toJson('keepAlive', ''))
            }.bind(this), this._keepAliveInterval)
        }
    },
    __success: function(e) {
        this.keepAlive();
        this._success(e)
    }
});
```

We see that the "WebsocketSudoComponent" component, defines the function for sending messages to the WebSocket server.
In order to discover the messages that are available to be sent to the server, we can search for any calls to the ".send()" function. To do this, we'll grep for "send(" in the uncompressed files.

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t7-ss31.png)

After looking for the same, and cleaning up the output, we see the following messages being sent to the server.
Clearly, all system level commands being sent as messages are from controllers.js.
The "execute_nagios_command" command seems to indicate that it triggers some form of command execution.
Looking for the same term in controller.js file, we run across 2 instances, first being the following:

```javascript
loadConsole: function() {
        this.$jqconsole = $('#console').jqconsole('', 'nagios$ ');
        this.$jqconsole.Write(this.getVar('console_welcome'));
        var startPrompt = function() {
            var self = this;
            self.$jqconsole.Prompt(!0, function(input) {
                self.WebsocketSudo.send(self.WebsocketSudo.toJson('execute_nagios_command', input));
                startPrompt()
            })
        }.bind(this);
        startPrompt()
    }
```

A closer inspection of this code confirms that this function may result in RCE.
This is because we see the execute_nagios_command, inside the send function, referred inside the "loadConsole" function, with an "input" variable supplied as the 2nd argument.
Moreover, jqconsole, is the jQuery terminal plugin.

## Decoding the Communication

We can now start to backtrack the communication, and find out what exactly is being executed and weather we can control it.
Looking at the code again, we see that the final function being called is "toJson".
We can look for the function definition, and see what it does:

```JavaScript
toJson: function(task, data) {
        var jsonArr = [];
        jsonArr = JSON.stringify({
            task: task,
            data: data,
            uniqid: this._uniqid,
            key: this._key
        });
        return jsonArr
    }
```

Reading the function definition, it takes 2 arguments, the task(execute_nagios_command) and the data(the input variable).
The function then creates a JSON string of an object that contains the task, the data, a unique id, and a key.
We must determine the source of _uniqid_ and _key_. Further investigation reveals that the _uniqid_ is defined above the _toJson_ function in a function named \_onResponse:

```JavaScript
onResponse: function(e) {
        var transmitted = JSON.parse(e.data);
        switch (transmitted.type) {
            case 'connection':
                this._uniqid = transmitted.uniqid;
                this.__success(e);
                break;
            case 'response':
                if (this._uniqid === transmitted.uniqid) {
                    this._callback(transmitted)
                }
                break;
            case 'dispatcher':
                this._dispatcher(transmitted);
                break;
            case 'event':
                if (this._uniqid === transmitted.uniqid) {
                    this._event(transmitted)
                }
                break;
            case 'keepAlive':
                break
        }
    }
```

The function is executed when a message comes in.
Based on the code, we can tell that the uniqid is set to a value provided by the server itself.
Thus, we should expect at some point during the connection for the server to send us a _uniqid_ value.
We also note that there are 5 cases, based on which the response is sent(connection, response, dispatcher, event and keepAlive).

With this in mind, we can now proceed to find the value of the key.
Heading further up, we see that inside the "setup" function, the key value is referred.
When _setup_ is called, the WebSocket URL and the \_key variable in the WebsocketSudo component are set:

```javascript
setup: function(wsURL, key) {
        this._wsUrl = wsURL;
        this._key = key
    }
```

To move on, we can grep for calls of this function.
We find many calls to this function, but the most relevant one is inside app_controller.js:

```javascript
./app_controller.js:
this.WebsocketSudo.setup(this.getVar('websocket_url'), this.getVar('akey'));
```

Here, we see that the arguments being passed are the same from commands.html.
We thus have everything, to construct a custom nagios_execute_command task.
However, no task should be left undone, and thus we will complete our backtracking to find and inspect the initial connection process of the Websocket server.
For this, we go back to the components.js file as it seems to define most of the basic components.
Here we see the connect function:

```JavaScript
connect: function() {
        if (this._connection === null) {
            this._connection = new WebSocket(this._wsUrl)
        }
        this._connection.onopen = this._onConnectionOpen.bind(this);
        this._connection.onmessage = this._onResponse.bind(this);
        this._connection.onerror = this._onError.bind(this);
        return this._connection
    }
```

The function creates a new WebSocket connection, if one doesn't already exists.
Then, it sets the onopen, onmessage and onerror, event handlers, and finally returns the connection.
Inspecting further, the onopen event handler, calls the onConnectionOpen function.
Looking for it we find the following code:

```javascript
onConnectionOpen: function(e) {
        this.requestUniqId()
    }
```

By the looks of it, the function requests a new uniqid.
Following the function definition:

```JavaScript
requestUniqId: function() {
        this.send(this.toJson('requestUniqId', ''))
    },
```

The function sends a request to the server, requesting a new uniqid(pretty obvious).

With this, we have found our exploitation point.
We now just need to understand and interact with the WebSocket, and execute commands of our choice.
