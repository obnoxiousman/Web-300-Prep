## Understanding DOM
In order to understand DOM-based XSS, we must first familiarize ourselves with the Document Object Model (DOM).
When a browser interprets an HTML page, it must render the individual HTML elements.
The rendering creates objects of each element for display.

HTML elements like _div_ can contain other HTML elements like _h1_. When parsed by a browser, the _div_ object is created and contains a _h1_ object as the child node.
The hierarchical tree created by the objects that represent the individual HTML elements make up the Document Object Model.
The HTML elements can be identified by id, class, tag name, and other identifiers that propagate to the objects in the DOM.

Browsers generate a DOM from HTML so they can enable programmatic manipulation of a page via JavaScript.
Developers may use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM for background tasks, UI changes, etc, all from the client's browser.
While the dynamic changes could be done on the server side by dynamically generating the HTML and sending it back to the user, this adds a significant delay to the application.

For this manipulation to occur, JavaScript implements the _Document_ interface. To query for an object on the DOM, the _document_ interface implements APIs like _getElementById_, _getElementsByClassName_, and _getElementsByTagName_.

The objects that are returned from the query inherit from the _Element_ base class. The _Element_ class contains properties like _innerHTML_ to manipulate the content within the HTML element. The _Document_ interface allows for direct writing to the DOM via the  write() method.
_DOM-based XSS_ can occur if unsanitized user input is provided to a property, like _innerHTML_ or a method like _write()_.

Considering the following example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script>
    const queryString = location.search;
    const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString);
    const name = urlParams.get('name')
    document.write('<h1>Hello, ' + name + '!</h1>');
  </script>
</head>
</html>
```

Here, the JavaScript between the script tags will first extract the query string from the URL. Using the _URLSearchParams_ interface, the constructor will parse the query string and return a _URLSearchParams_ object, which is saved in the _urlParams_ variable.
Next, the name parameter is extracted from the URL parameters using the _get_ method.
Finally, an _h1_ element is written to the document using the name passed as a query string.

Opening the following code on a browser, and passing a name to the variable, displays "hello" with the passed parameter:

![](../../03.%20Images/t7-ss6.png)

However, if we append 

```javascript
"?name=<script>alert(1)</script>" 
```

to the URL, the browser executes our JavaScript code:

![](../../03.%20Images/t7-ss8.png)

If a file like this were hosted on a server, the resulting vulnerability would be a categorized as _reflected DOM-based XSS_.
It is important to note that DOM-based XSS can also be stored if the value appended to the DOM is obtained from a user-controlled database value.
