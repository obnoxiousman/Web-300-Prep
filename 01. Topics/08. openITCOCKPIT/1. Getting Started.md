## Introduction
openITCOCKPIT is an application that aids in the configuration and management of two popular monitoring utilities: Nagios and Naemon.
The vendor offers both an open-source community version and an enterprise version with premium extensions.

## BlackBox
Although openITCOCKPIT is an open source application, we will attempt to discover vulnerabilities without viewing the source code, emulating a black box examination.

A black box test, has a more broader feel than a white box test.
For example, an "SQL syntax" error obviously suggests the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability.
During a white box assessment, we would check the code and, if input is not escaped properly, we could formulate an exploit.
However, in a black box assessment, we might not be able to discover the proper string to exploit the injection or the input might be escaped properly but the error is caused by something else.
If we concentrate all of our resources into one potential vulnerability, we might miss other potential attack vectors.

The discovery phase of this module is critical as is building a proper site map. Our first step will be to build the site map to obtain a holistic view of the endpoints exposed and the libraries used by the application.
