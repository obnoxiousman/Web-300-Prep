## Explaination

Before we discuss the JavaScript prototype, we must first understand that nearly everything in JavaScript is an object. This includes arrays, Browser APIs, and functions. The only exceptions are null, undefined, strings, numbers, Booleans, and symbols.

In JavaScript, there are no classes. This can be shown through a simple NodeJS shell:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss10.png)

Here, we find that the **Student** class, is actually a function and not a class. The class keyword was introduced in 2015, to make JavaScript more user-friendly to users who normally work with class-based programming languages.

Before ES2015, a class would just be a constructor function as follows:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss11.png)

This is a different way of defining a class in JavaScript, using a function and the `prototype` property, which creates a method for the class.
The method is subsequently inherited by any object, inheriting the class.

Here, we see:
1. The class keyword in JavaScript is just syntactic sugar for the _constructor_ function.
2. Both class and the constructor function use the _new_ keyword to create an object from the class.

According to the documentation, JavaScript's **new** keyword will first create an empty object.
Within that object, it will set the `__proto__` value to the constructor function's prototype (in the example above, we have used the method name to be **isActive**). With `__proto__` set, the **new** keyword ensures that **this** refers to the context of the newly created object. 
The image shows that **this.id** and **this.enrolled** of the new object are set to the respective values.
Finally, **this** is returned (unless the function returns its own object).

JavaScript uses prototype inheritance, which means that an object inherits properties from another object. If we refer back to our constructor function and class, **Student** is a function (don't forget that functions are also objects).
When we create an **s** object, the **new** keyword inherits from the **Student** object.
This is beneficial as in this case, one object, can inherit from multiple object prototypes.
In addition, the properties inherited from higher-level objects can be modified during runtime(even though it is not recommended).

However, with usability, comes bad security, if higher-level objects can be modified, they can be used maliciously.

Now, what happens, if we call the isActive function, directly from the "Class":

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss12.png)

As expected, the function executed, logged to the console, and returned "undefined" since **enrolled** is not set in the prototype instance.
This means, that to return the "this" object, an object needs to be created in the first place, however, we're calling the method directly from the "Class", thus it says undefined.

What if we try to access **isActive** within the **Student** function constructor instead of the prototype:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss13.png)

We see, that the function is not defined.
This is because **prototype** is not part of the prototype chain but `__proto__` is.
Meaning, if we run isActive() on the **s** object, we are actually running within `s.__proto__.isActive()`.

We can validate this by creating a new isActive() function, directly in the **s** object, instead of running the one in the `__proto__` , delete the newly created function, and observing the chain resolving back to the function from `__proto__`:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss14.png)

The `__proto__` property is a non-standard way to access the prototype of an object. When you call a method on an object using the `__proto__` property, it bypasses the object itself and looks for the method directly on the object's prototype.

In this case, we first create a class(constructor function) called Student, that has a prototype isActive().
Then, create a new object s that inherits from the Student class we created.
Then, we create a new function s.isActive, which will print a statement, and then return true.
Due to it's name, the function overshadows the method in the prototype, and when is called, prints the statement and returns true.
Now, even though the function is shadowed, when we call `s.__proto__.isActive()`, the isActive method, on the PROTOTYPE of the s object, is called, bypassing the s object.
Now, as there is no "this" context, the console prints "Checking if active", and then prints undefined because there is no "this" context.
Finally, when we delete the newly created s.isActive function, the isActive method inherited from the prototype of the Student constructor function, can be accessed, and thus displays False.

We can also update the chain by simply creating a new method of the same name inside the constructor function:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss15.png)

There are other methods of the s object, that we never set for example the toString() method:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss16.png)

The **toString** function returns a string representation of the object.
This **toString** function is a built-in function in the prototype of the _Object_ class.
The Object class in itself is a constructor function that all objects are created from, meaning, all created objects inherit from the built-in **Object** constructor function.

The cycle goes as follows:
1. The Student(object) constructor function, inherits from the Object constructor function.
2. The s object, inherits from the Student constructor function.
3. and so on.

We can even add our own toString() method, to the Student constructor function, so when any object inherits the Student class, the method from the Object class, will hide:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss17.png)

And we can even add the toString function to the s object:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss18.png)

At this point, the prototype chain has 3 toString functions:
1. The 1st one is in the s object, which we have defined as a normal function.
2. The 2nd one is in the Student constructor function, which is a defined as a method
3. Finally, the 3rd one is in the Object constructor function itself, which is inherited whenever an object is created.

The prototype chain will always select the one that comes up first in the search.

Now, even though this is not recommended, we will do this for explanation purposes.
What happens if we change the toString method of the Object constructor function:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss19.png)

The prototype chain points to our custom toString method, of the Object constructor function.
And this remains the same till the NodeJS application/shell is not restarted, meaning if we even create a randomly new object using the Object constructor function, it will still have our custom toString(), method:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss20.png)

Note: we had to define the id property, because if not, the prototype chain would error out.
At this point, we have polluted the prototype of nearly every object in JavaScript and changed the _toString_ function every time it is executed.

## The Exploit

Prototype pollution was not always considered a security issue.
In fact, it was used as a feature to extend JavaScript in third-party libraries.

However, if an application accepts user input and allows us to inject into the prototype of Object, this creates a security issue.
While there are many situations that might cause this, it often occurs in **_extend_** or **_merge_** type functions. These functions merge objects together to create a new merged or extended object.

An example would be as follows:

```JavaScript
const { isObject } = require("util");   

function merge(a,b) {
	for (var key in b){
		if (isObject(a[key]) && isObject(b[key])) {
			merge(a[key], b[key])
		}else {
			a[key] = b[key];
		}
	}
	return a
}
```

The _merge_ function above accepts two objects.
It iterates through each key in the second object.
If the value of the key in the first and second object are also objects, the function will recursively call itself and pass in the two objects.
If these are not objects, the value of the key in the first object will be set to the value of the key in the second object using computed property names.

Using this function, we can merge to objects:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss21.png)

This might not be interesting in itself, however, it gets interesting when we set the `__proto__` key in the second object, to another object:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss22.png)

When the **merge** function runs, it will iterate through all the keys in the **y** object.
The only key in this object is `__proto__`.

Since `x["__proto__"]` will always be an object (remember, it's a link to the prototype of the parent object) and `y["__proto__"]` will be an object (since we set it to one), the if statement will be true.
This means that the _merge_ function will be called using `x["__proto__"]` and `y["__proto__"]` as arguments.

When the merge function runs again, the **for** loop will enumerate the keys of `y["__proto__"]`.
The only attribute of `y["__proto__"]` is "bar".
Since this attribute does not exist in `x["__proto__"]`, the **if** statement will be false and the **else** branch will be executed.
The _else_ branch will set the value of `x["__proto__"]["foo"]` to the value of `y["__proto__"]["foo"]` (or "foobar").

However, since `x["__proto__"]` is pointing to the Object class prototype, then all objects will be polluted due to the merge.
We can witness this by checking the value of **bar** in newly created objects:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss23.png)

This can become a problem when we start adding attributes such as "isAdmin" to all objects. Meaning if the application is coded in a way that objects with "isAdmin" attribute set, have administrator privileges, all objects will get to have administrator privileges.

Even if `___proto___` of one object is the prototype of a user-defined class (like in our **Student** example earlier), we can chain multiple `__proto__` keys until we reach the Object class prototype:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss24.png)

In this case, when we set the `__proto__` object only one level deep, we are actually only interacting with the prototype of the _Student_ class.
As a result, both _s_ and _s2_ have the value of _foo_ set to "bar"

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss25.png)

However, when we set the `__proto__` object multiple levels deep, we find that we begin interacting higher up in the prototype chain.
At that point, all objects start to have the value of _foo_ set to "bar".

There are a few more minor details about prototype pollution that we should consider before moving on.

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss26.png)

1. Variables polluted into the prototype are enumerable in _for...in_ statements.
2. The polluted variables are also enumerable in arrays.
3. If a loop uses the array length, the polluted variables are not enumerated.
4. This is also true of the _forEach_ loop since ECMAScript specifies that _forEach_ use the length of the array.
