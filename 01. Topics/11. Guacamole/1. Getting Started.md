## Prototype Pollution

Prototype pollution refers to a JavaScript vulnerability in which an attacker can inject properties in every object created by an application.
While prototype pollution is not a new JavaScript concept, it has only recently become an attack vector.

Prototype pollution vulnerabilities often appear in libraries that merge or extend objects.
For a web application to be vulnerable to prototype pollution in an exploitable way, it must use a vulnerable merge/extend function and provide a path to code execution or authentication bypass using the injected properties.

In this case study, Guacamole-lite uses a library that is vulnerable to prototype pollution when processing untrusted user input.
We will leverage prototype pollution against two different templating engines to achieve RCE on the target.

## Feeling the Application

For this vulnerability, we will be targeting an application called "Chips".
The application provides access to RDP clients via a web interface.

To start our reconnaissance, we will find the inputs, switch templating engines, and connect to the application via a remote debugger.

We will start by exploring the application with burpsuite in background, and move on to find any interesting points.

The home page of the web application is fairly simple.
There's an about section, that explains what the application is about, a connect button, to create an RDP connection via the web interface, and an Advanced Connection Settings button, to set the settings for the connection.

The three most interesting requests after creating a connection are the following:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss2.png)

First, we discover a POST to **/tokens** containing a JSON payload with the connection information.
The server replies with a token.

Next:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss3.png)

We find a request to **/rdp** with a _token_ query parameter containing a base64 payload.
When decoded, the payload displays a JSON object containing "iv" and "value" parameters. This means that the payload is encrypted.

Finally:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss4.png)

We also find a GET request to /guaclite with the same token value discovered earlier.
This request responds with a "101 Switching Protocols" response, which is used to start a WebSocket connection.
Navigating to the WebSocket history tab, we can also confirm that a connection is being made, for the RDP connection via the web interface.

With some functionalities in our view, we can now start targeting them.


## Understanding the Code

Upon opening the source code in VS code, we see the following structure of the folders:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss5.png)

The existence of **bin/www**, **package.json**, and **routes/** indicate that this is a NodeJS web application.
In particular, package.json identifies a NodeJS project and manages its dependencies.

Moreover, the existence of the docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile files indicate that this application is started using Docker containers.
Reviewing package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "chips",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start-dev": "node --inspect=0.0.0.0 ./bin/www",
    "watch": "webpack watch --mode development",
    "start": "webpack build --mode production && node ./bin/www",
    "build": "webpack build --mode development"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.13.1",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.13.5",
    "autoprefixer": "^9.8.6",
    "babel-loader": "^8.2.2",
    "clean-webpack-plugin": "^3.0.0",
    "mini-css-extract-plugin": "^1.3.9",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.7",
    "postcss-loader": "^3.0.0",
    "precss": "^4.0.0",
    "sass": "^1.32.8",
    "sass-loader": "^11.0.1",
    "style-loader": "^2.0.0",
    "webpack": "^5.24.2",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.5.0",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.2",
    "jquery": "^3.5.1",
    "popper.js": "^1.16.1",
    "guacamole-common-js": "^1.3.0",
    "bootstrap": "^4.6.0",
    "css-loader": "^5.1.0",
    "axios": "^0.21.1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cookie-parser": "~1.4.4",
    "debug": "~2.6.9",
    "dockerode": "^3.2.1",
    "dotenv": "^8.2.0",
    "ejs": "^3.1.6",
    "express": "~4.16.1",
    "guacamole-lite": "0.6.3",
    "hbs": "^4.1.1",
    "http-errors": "~1.6.3",
    "morgan": "~1.9.1",
    "pug": "^3.0.2"
  }
}
```

The package.json file indicates a few things:
1. The application is started using the /bin/www file.
2. "Webpack" is installed. Webpack is used to bundle external client side packages such as jQuery, and custom JavaScript code into a single file to be served by the web server. This means that the **frontend** directory will most likely contain all the frontend assets, including the code that started the WebSocket connection.
3. The application is built using the express framework, meaning the **routes** directory will contain the definitions of the endpoints we found.

Now, we can move on to the /bin/www file:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss6.png)

The main points of interest are the import function of app.js, which is used to create the server.
We also see the guacamole-lite function being imported.
Before the HTTP server is started, the server is passed into the GuacamoleLite Constructor, which will allow the guacamole-lite package to create endpoints that are not defined in Express.
On the next lines, the HTTP server is started.

Moving on to app.js:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss7.png)

The file sets up many parts of the application.
We discover the tow of the routes that are defined, which we see in the frontend application i.e. **/rdp** and **/token**.
We also find that the file allows us to set the templating engine from 3 choices, i.e. Handlebars(hbs), EJS or Pug, with default being hbs.

Finally the docker-compose.yml file:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  chips:
    build: .
    command: npm run start-dev
    restart: always
    environment:
      - TEMPLATING_ENGINE
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - "80:3000"
      - "9229:9229"
      - "9228:9228"
  guacd:
    restart: always
    image: linuxserver/guacd
    container_name: guacd

  rdesktop:
    restart: always
    image: linuxserver/rdesktop
    container_name: rdesktop
    volumes:
      - ./shared:/shared
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
```

The script reveals that we can start the application with the _start-dev_ script (from package.json).
This script starts the application on port 9229 with debugging enabled.

Finally, we find that web application container (chips) is started with /var/run/docker.sock mounted.
This gives the chips container full access to the Docker socket.
With access to the Docker socket, we may be able to escape the container and obtain RCE on the host if we can get RCE on the web app container.

## Configuring Remote Debugging

We have a launch.json file prepared to perform remote debugging in our application:

```JSON
{

	"version": "0.2.0",
	"configurations": [
		{
			"type": "node",
			"request": "attach",
			"name": "Attach to remote",
			"address": "chips",
			"port": 9229,
			"localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
			"remoteRoot": "/usr/src/app"
		},
		{
			"type": "node",
			"request": "attach",
			"name": "Attach to remote (cli)",
			"address": "chips",
			"port": 9228,
			"localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
			"remoteRoot": "/usr/src/app"
		}
	]
}
```

There are two remote debugging profiles configured.
The first is on port 9229.
The application is already started using the _start-dev_ script from package.json, which will start Node on port 9229.
To validate that this is working, we need to navigate to the _Run and Debug_ tab in Visual Studio Code and start the profile.

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss8.png)

Running the debugger, we see that we're connected to the guacamole-lite WebSocket server.

For the CLI, we will first start the NodeJS with debugging enabled, from the web application container, in a new terminal window.
To do this, we will use docker-compose with the exec command:

```shell
docker-compose -f ~/chips/docker-compose.yml exec chips node --inspect=0.0.0.0:9228
```

The command we want to execute is node --inspect=0.0.0.0:9228 to start an interactive shell but open port 9228 for remote debugging.
Next, we can select the _Attach to remote (cli)_ setting in Visual Studio Code and start debugging:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss9.png)

The bottom bar in the IDE should again turn orange and debugging should begin. We should also get a "Debugger attached" message in the interactive node shell.

The benefit of debugging via the cli is that we can now set breakpoints in individual libraries, load them in the interactive cli, and run individual methods without making changes to the web application and reloading every time.
With remote debugging set up, we can begin exploring how JavaScript prototype works and how to exploit a prototype pollution vulnerability.
