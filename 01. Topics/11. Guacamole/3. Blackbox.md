## Discovery

The first caveat we need to understand, is that we usually cannot pass direct JavaScript objects within HTTP requests. Instead, the requests would need to contain some kind of serialized data, such as JSON.

In these situations, when a vulnerable merge function is executed, the data is first parsed from a JSON object into a JavaScript object.
More commonly, libraries will include middleware that will automatically parse an HTTP request body, with "application/json" content type, as JSON.

To discover a prototype pollution vulnerability, we can replace one of the commonly used functions in the Object prototype in order to get the application to crash.
For example, _toString_ is a good target since many libraries use it and if a string is provided instead of a function, the application would crash.

We might need to continue using the application beyond the initial pollution to understand how the exploit impacts it.
The initial request might start the prototype pollution, but it requires subsequent requests to realize the impact.

Many applications in production will run with the application started as a daemon and restart automatically if the application crashes.
In these situations, the application might hang until the restart is complete, it might return a 500, or it might return a 200 with incomplete output. In these scenarios, we need to search for anything that is out of the ordinary.

Earlier, we discovered our target application accepts JSON on input in POST requests to the /token endpoint.
That can be our first target.
We will start by catching the POST request, in burp:

Next, let's add a payload that will replace the _toString_ function with a string in the object prototype (if it's vulnerable).
We'll add this at end of the JSON after the _connection_ object and send the request:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss28.png)

Even after injecting the payload:

Nothing much changes about the application.
However, if the application is running the payload through a vulnerable merge function, it is possible that only some objects are merged. Let's examine the original JSON in the payload.

The _connection_ object has two keys: _type_ and _settings_.
An object like _settings_ is popular for merging because the developer may have a set of defaults that they wish to use but extend those defaults with user-provided settings.

This time, let's attempt to set the payload in the _settings_ object instead of the _connection_ object and send the request:

## The Payload

Executing the payload:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss31.png)

We see that we have successfully, crashed the application.
This means that our payload got triggered, and broke the application.

To understand what's happening, we can log in and check the logs:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss32.png)

Here, we see that the application did crash due to prototype pollution.

The **moment** library attempted to run _toString_.
When it did, the application crashed with an "Object.prototype.toString.call is not a function" error.
