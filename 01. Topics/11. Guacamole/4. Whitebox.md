## Understanding the Vulnerability

We can search for computed property names that accept a variable to reference a key in an object (as we discovered in the _merge_ function)
To do this, we would search for square brackets with a variable in between.
However, the target application (not including the additional libraries) is so small that searching for a single square bracket is feasible.
Looking for open square brackets in JavaScript files:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss33.png)

The search revealed four files.
The only interesting files are routes/index.js and routes/files.js but they uses the square bracket to access an array, which protects it from prototype pollution.

With the application source code ruled out for prototype pollution, let's start reviewing the libraries.
We will use the following command to look for dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose -f ~/chips/docker-compose.yml run chips npm list -prod -depth 1
```

We will search this list for anything that might merge or extend objects.
We find a few interesting names:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss34.png)

We can visit each of these libraries GitHub repository.
we find that 2 of the libraries, basically implement a _badMerge_ function. That makes these libraries immune to prototype pollution.

However, deep-extend might be interesting as it's described as a library for "Recursive object extending."
The deep-extend function is as follows:
```JavaScript
var deepExtend = module.exports = function (/*obj_1, [obj_2], [obj_N]*/) {
	if (arguments.length < 1 || typeof arguments[0] !== 'object') {
		return false;
	}

	if (arguments.length < 2) {
		return arguments[0];
	}

	var target = arguments[0];

	// convert arguments to array and cut off target object
	var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);

	var val, src, clone;

	args.forEach(function (obj) {
		// skip argument if isn't an object, is null, or is an array
		if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null || Array.isArray(obj)) {
			return;
		}

		Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (key) {
			src = target[key]; // source value
			val = obj[key]; // new value

			// recursion prevention
			if (val === target) {
				return;

			/**
			 * if new value isn't object then just overwrite by new value
			 * instead of extending.
			 */
			} else if (typeof val !== 'object' || val === null) {
				target[key] = val;
				return;

			// just clone arrays (and recursive clone objects inside)
			} else if (Array.isArray(val)) {
				target[key] = deepCloneArray(val);
				return;

			// custom cloning and overwrite for specific objects
			} else if (isSpecificValue(val)) {
				target[key] = cloneSpecificValue(val);
				return;

			// overwrite by new value if source isn't object or array
			} else if (typeof src !== 'object' || src === null || Array.isArray(src)) {
				target[key] = deepExtend({}, val);
				return;

			// source value and new value is objects both, extending...
			} else {
				target[key] = deepExtend(src, val);
				return;
			}
		});
	});

	return target;
}
```

The code block is fairly similar to the vulnerable _merge_ function that we created.
The first argument to the **deepExtend** function will become the target object to extend and the remaining arguments will be looped through.
In our merge example, we accepted two objects.
In deep-extend, the library will theoretically process an infinite number of objects.
The keys of the subsequent objects will be looped through and, if the value of the key is not an object, the key of the target will be set to the value of the object to be merged.
If the value is an object, _deepExtend_ will recursively call itself, merging the objects.
Nowhere in the source code would an object with the `"__proto__"` key be removed.

Now that we've discovered a library that is vulnerable to prototype pollution, let's find where it is used. The _npm list_ command showed us that this was found in the guacamole-lite library.
The directory has 4 files:
1. ClientConnection.js
2. Crypt.js
3. GuacdClient.js
4. Server.js

Since the requests that might contain user input are handled by the node_modules/guacamole-lite/lib/ClientConnection.js, this file is worth reviewing.
First, the function gets imported:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss35.png)

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss36.png)

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss37.png)

We find that the deep-extend library is imported at the start.
We also find that the constructor will first decrypt a token on and save it to the **this.connectionSettings** variable.
The _token_ parameter we found earlier was encrypted.

After the token is decrypted, the file will run **mergeConnectionOptions**, which calls deep-extend with the most notable arguments being the decrypted settings from the user input.

More specifically, the **settings** object within the **connection** object is passed to the **DeepExtend** function. This is why the payload worked in the **settings** object during blackbox discovery, but not the **connection** object.

## Templates

A useful prototype pollution exploit is application and library-dependent.
For example, if the application has admin and non-admin users, it might be possible to set _isAdmin_ to true in the Object prototype, convincing the application that all users are administrators.

However, this also assumes that non-admin users never have the _isAdmin_ parameter explicitly set to false. If _isAdmin_ was set to false in the object directly, the prototype chain wouldn't be used for that variable.

With prototype pollution, we may be able to reach code execution if we find a point in the application where undefined variables are appended to a **child_process.exec**, **eval** or **vm.runInNewContext** function, or similar.

For instance:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss38.png)

In this example, the **log** key in the **options** object is explicitly set to true.
However, the **preface** is not explicitly set. If we injected a payload into the **preface** key in the Object prototype before **options** is set, we would be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

Then, we are successfully able to inject our own **console.log** statement and comment out the others.
Third-party libraries often contain these types of code blocks, and developers may implement them without realizing the risk.

From here on out, we can move on to identify the non-development dependencies:

![](../../03.%20Images/t10-ss39.png)

The three templating engine packages, **ejs**, **hbs**, and **pug**.
JavaScript templating engines often compile a template into JavaScript code and evaluate the compiled template.
A library like this is perfect for our purposes
If we can find a way to inject code during the compilation process or during the conversion to JavaScript code, we might be able to achieve command execution.
