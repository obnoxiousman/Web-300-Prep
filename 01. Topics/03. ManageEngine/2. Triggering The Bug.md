## Enable Database Logging
For the purpose of testing if our exploit truly works or not, we need to enable database logging.
We can do the same by editing the log_statement entry in the following file:

```path
C:\Program Files (x86)\ManageEngine\AppManager12\working\pgsql\data\amdb\postgresql.conf
```

All the database queries and errors will then be logged into the following file:

```path
C:\Program Files (x86)\ManageEngine\AppManager12\working\pgsql\data\amdb\pgsql_log\
```

## Triggering The Bug
Going back the web.xml file, we can find the URL that we need to reach to reach the vulnerable code:

![](../../03.%20Images/t2-ss6.png)

Visiting the URL, and providing the required arguments, with a line terminator, we don't see anything special.
In fact, we get an empty response from the server:

![](../../03.%20Images/t2-ss7.png)

However, reading the database logging file, we see something interesting:

![](../../03.%20Images/t2-ss8.png)

If we take a look at the vulnerable query:
```sql
select distinct(RESOURCEID) from AM_USERRESOURCESTABLE
where USERID=" + userId + " and RESOURCEID >" + stRange + " and
RESOURCEID < " + endRange
```

our injection point is in the userId variable.
The next part of the query, starts with an and. which means because we injected an sql line terminator after userId, the new query start with an "and" operator, and gave us an sql syntax error.
An interesting thing, about postgres sql injection, is that it allows stacked queries. Thus we have multiple ways of data exfiltration and achieving remote code execution.

However, a downside of stacked queries, is that it returns multiple sets, which can break the logic of the application and cause it to error out.
To solve this caveat, we will be using time-based blind injection payloads.

If we send one payload to our vulnerable code using the pg_sleep() function:
```url
/servlet/AMUserResourcesSyncServlet?ForMasRange=1&userId=1;
select+pg_sleep(5);
```

We see that we get a result delayed by 5 seconds proving that our injection works:
