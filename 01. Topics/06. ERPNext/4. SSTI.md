## Templating Engines
With the authentication bypassed, we now need to explore more of the application to find a vulnerability that can get us remote code execution.
Templating engines are used to render a static file dynamically based on the context of the request and user.
This allows developers to centralize the location of reusable content and to further separate the view from the Model-View-Controller paradigm.

A templating engine leverages delimiters so developers can tell the engine where a template block starts and ends.
In Python (and Jinja), an expression is a combination of variables and operations that results in a value:
(_7*7_)
while a statement will represent an action:
(_print("hello")_).
A common delimiter to start an expression is "{{", with "}}" used to end expressions.

How templating engines work is crucial to understand to exploit it.
Take an instance of using the python "len" function:

In a templating engine, like jinja, we can carry out the same operation, by piping a variable into the "length" filter.
However, jinja, itself, uses the python len function, to carry out the same operation.

If an application gives us the ability to inject into templates, we might be able to escape the "sandbox" of the templating engine and run system-level code.
Some templating engines contain direct classes to execute system-level calls while others make it more difficult, requiring creative exploits.

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities might also hint at an SSTI vulnerability since user-provided code is being entered into an unsanitized field.
To discover SSTI, we commonly use a payload like "{{ 7\*7 }}". If the response is "49", we know that the payload was processed.

A common payload to exploit jinja is:

```jinja
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[2].__subclasses__()[40]('/etc/passwd').read() }}
```

To understand this payload, we need dig deeper.
The payload starts by creating an empty string, with 2 quotes.
Then, the class attribute returns the class to which the string belongs to(in this case the 'str' class).
Once the class is returned, the payload uses Method Resolution Order(mro) attribute.

To understand this, we will need to understand that, in python, one class can inherit another class.
To understand this better, we'll take the following example:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss35.png)

The parent class Food has attributes calories.
A class of _Fruit_ would inherit from Food, but could also build on it with levels of Fructose, which are not as important to track on other food items like meat.
The chain continues, with the Strawberry class inheriting Fruit class and builds a ripeness attribute.

If we were to access the mro attribute of the Strawberry class, we would discover the resolution order for the class:

```python
>>> Strawberry.__mro__

(<class '__main__.Strawberry'>, <class '__main__.Fruit'>, <class '__main__.Food'>, <class 'object'>)
```

The output suggests that, if for instance we access the calories attribute, the strawberry class would be search for, then the fruit class, then the food class, and finally the object class.
(NOTE: In python3, whenever a class is created, the built-in object class is inherited)

Now that we understand the basics, we can run the payload and understand what it calls:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss36.png)

We see that the object class is accessed by the payload.
Next, the payload runs the subclasses method within the object class that was returned by the mro attribute.
The subclasses will return all references to the class from which we are calling it.

Thus, in python2.7, the 40 subclass, is file, which can be used to call the file method, which can be used to list any files in the system:
