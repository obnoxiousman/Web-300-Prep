## What is ERPNext
ERPNext is an open source Enterprise Resource Planning software built on the Frappe Web Framework.
The 2 vulnerabilities in the framework to be discussed are:\
1. SQL Injection to bypass authentication
2. Server Side Template Injection(SSTI) to get remote code execution

We will be attacking as an unauthenticated user, and take a white-box approach.

**Configure SMTP**

```JSON
"mail_server":"192.168.119.184",
 "use_ssl":0,
 "mail_port":25,
 "auto_email_id":"admin@randomdomain.com"
```

**Attach debugger**

```python
import ptvsd
ptvsd.enable_attach(redirect_output=True)
print("Now ready for the IDE to connect to the debugger")
ptvsd.wait_for_attach()

#start debugger with 
#../env/bin/python ../apps/frappe/frappe/utils/bench_helper.py frappe serve --port 8000 --noreload --nothreading
```


## Intro to MVC
Before we start exploiting the framework, we need to have a good understanding of  the Model-View-Controller design pattern, Metadata-driven architecture, and HTTP routing.
These concepts will teach us how to read the Frappe and ERPNext code and discover vulnerabilities within the code base.

**Example**
A cashier uses an input device to key in purchases.
The Point-of-Sale system will then process the order, calculate the tax, and store it in a database.
This system can also print an invoice as output.
In mathematical terms, this input-process-output process is known as a function machine.
Once we start adding in different product types and taxing systems, hundreds of stores, and thousands of users, the application starts to get daunting and might result in "spaghetti code".

To prevent spaghetti code, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern was created by Trygve Reenskaug in 1979.
The MVC software design pattern helps organize project code to increase reusability.

 If a developer manually interacts with an SQL database, they may inadvertently (and insecurely) concatenate the SQL statement with client-provided data, resulting in SQL injection.
 Instead, in an MVC architecture, the data is pulled once from a central location and reused throughout the application

As the name suggests, the MVC design pattern is separated into three components: 
1. the model
2. the view 
3. the controller

**The Controller**
In the context of a web application, the _controller_ handles the input received from the user. This could be in the form of a HTTP route (i.e. /user/update) or via a parameter.
The controller maps the user's input to the function(s) that will be executed.

**The Model**
The _model_ in Model-View-Controller maps data to a specific object and defines the logic that is needed to process the data.
The model is the central component of "bridging the gap between the human user's mental model and the digital model".
A user object or a product object is an example of a model.

**The View**
The _view_ is the final output that is provided to the user.
In the context of a web application, this can be the HTML, XML, or any other final representation that is provided to the user to be consumed.

## Metadata-Driven Design Patterns
A metadata-driven design pattern creates a layer of abstraction that eases the new application development process.
This works well for generic database-driven applications like ERP software that allows users to customize stored data.
We can tell from the use of DocTypes that Frappe follows a metadata-driven design pattern.
Using DocTypes in this way helps developers reuse a single full-featured application or framework for multiple types of industries and business models.
Once the core of the framework/application is built, building additional features and data types is much easier.

Essentially, the Frappe "Kernel" grabs and parses the DocTypes to create the appropriate tables in the database.

One common goal of metadata-driven applications is to allow for the creation of the metadata documents via a GUI.

This concept is also displayed in ERPNext.
We can search for DocType after logging into the application:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss2.png)

Clicking on DocType List, it shows a list of all DocTypes:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss3.png)

Clicking the "Stock Entry Detail" DocType, shows the following result:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss4.png)

This doctype's code can be found at:
```path
apps/erpnext/erpnext/stock/doctype/stock_entry_detail/stock_entry_detail.json
```

The code looks like this:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss5.png)

DocTypes in Frappe are also accompanied by py files that contain additional logic and routes that support additional features.
For instance, the bank account DocType can be found:
```path
apps/erpnext/erpnext/accounts/doctype/bank_account/bank_account.py
```

Which has 3 functions:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss6.png)

The DocType encompasses the **model** element of MVC with a table in the database.
The **view** is the DocType's ability to be edited and displayed as a form (this includes the ability to edit the DocType within the UI).
Finally, the DocType acts as a **controller** by making use of the .py files that accompany the DocType.

Notice that the DocType Python file contained a string "@frappe.whitelist()" above each method.
This is one of the methods that Frappe uses to route HTTP requests to the appropriate functions.


#### HTTP Routing in Frappe
Frappe uses a Python _decorator_ with the function name _whitelist_ to expose API endpoints.
We can see this function defined in one of the init files:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss7.png)

Essentially, when a function has the "@frappe.whitelist()" decorator above it, the whitelist function is executed and the function being called is added to a list of whitelisted functions, "guest_methods", or "xss_safe_methods".

This list is then used by the handler found in the apps/frappe/frappe/handler.py file.

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss8.png)

Here, an HTTP request is first processed by the _handle_ function.
It extracts the _cmd_ that the request is attempting to execute.
This value is obtained from the _frappe.local.form_dict.cmd_ variable.
As long as the command is not "login" , the command is passed to the execute_cmd function.

Then in the execute_cmd function:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss9.png)

It will attempt to find the command and return the method.
If the method was found, Frappe will check if it is whitelisted using the "whitelisted list" mentioned previously.
If it is found, the function is executed.

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss10.png)

The is_whitelisted method simply checks to ensure the function being executed is in the list of whitelisted functions.
This means that the client can call any Frappe function directly if the @frappe.whitelist() decorator is in use for that function.
Moreover, if the allow_guest parameter, is also passed to the decorator, the user does not have to be authenticated.

If the is_whitelisted function does not raise any exceptions, the execute_cmd function will call frappe.call function and pass all the arguments in the request to the function.

It's time to open burpsuite and analyze how requests are being handled:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss11.png)

Visiting the login page, we find that the cmd variable is calling the is_chat_enabled function.
We also notice that Frappe uses a directory structure:

```path
frappe.website.doctype.website_settings.website_settings.is_chat_enabled

apps/frappe/frappe/website/doctype/website_settings/website_settings.py
```

Taking a look at the is_chat_enabled function:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t5-ss12.png)

We see that the function is whitelisted, and allow_guest variable is also set to true, causing it to be executed by an unauthenticated user.
We now know what to look for and can start our analysis.
