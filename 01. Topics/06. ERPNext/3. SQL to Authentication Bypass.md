## Our Options
Frappe passwords are hashed with PBK DF2 hashing algorithm.
While it might be possible to crack the passwords, an easier route might be to hijack the password reset token.
Let's visit the homepage to verify that Frappe does indeed have password reset functionality:

We need to determine what tables to query to extract the password reset token value.

## Find The Table
The Frappe documentation for passwords states that Frappe keeps the name and password in the \_\_Auth table.
However, this table does not have a field for the password reset key, so we'll have to search the database for the key location.

We can visit the password reset page.
From here, we can use a token value to reset the password.
This token will allow us to more easily search through the logs to find the correct entry.

We will give the entry of token_searchForUserTable@mail.com.
Sending the request, we will look for database entries with our provided email.
Looking for our string, we find the following query:

```mysql
select * from `tabUser` where `name` = 'token_searchForUserTable@mail.com' order by modified desc
```

We see that the table we're looking for is tabUser.

## Reset The Password
Now that we know all the tables we need to target, we can proceed to exploit this using our SQL injection.
The documentation says that the email can be found in the name column in the \_\_Auth table.

Thus our payload will be:
```mysql
mytext" UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,3,4,name FROM __Auth#
```

However, sending the payload gives us an error:

We run into the error "Illegal mix of collations for operation 'UNION'".
Database collation describes the rules determining how the database will compare characters in a character set.
These collations will not take the case into consideration when comparing values.
It is possible for us to force a collation within the query. However, we first need to discover the collation used in the \_\_global_search table that we are injecting into.
Thus, to find the collation being used, we'll use the following payload:

```mysql
mytext" UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,COLLATION_NAME FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE TABLE_NAME = "__global_search" AND COLUMN_NAME = "name";
```

Sending the payload, we find the collation being used:

![](../../03.%20Images/t5-ss26.png)

Now that we know the collation.
We can modify our payload so it does not throw us an error:

```mysql
mytext" UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,name COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci FROM __Auth#
```

Sending the payload, we are able to extract the administrator email:

![](../../03.%20Images/t5-ss27.png)

Now that we have the email, we can use this email in the forgot password page, and proceed to extract the password reset token;

![](../../03.%20Images/t5-ss29.png)

Before we extract the token, we need to know which column the token is stored in.
For that, we will use the following payload:

```mysql
mytext" UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,3,4,COLUMN_NAME FROM information_schema.columns WHERE TABLE_NAME = "tabUser"#
```

Sending the payload:

![](../../03.%20Images/t5-ss28.png)

We find the column we're looking for i.e. "reset_password_key" column.
Our next payload, will extract all the contents of the column and will look like so:

```mysql
mytext" UNION ALL SELECT name COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci,2,3,4,reset_password_key COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci FROM tabUser#
```

Sending the payload, we get the password reset token:

With the token in hand, we need to understand how to use it.
A great way to understand how to use the password reset token is to look for usage of the reset_password_key column from the tabUser table in the database:

![](../../03.%20Images/t5-ss31.png)

In the user.py file, we find a URL that with the key parameter, where if the token is passed, it will lead us to a password reset page.

We visit this URL with the captured token and are shown with a password reset page:

![](../../03.%20Images/t5-ss32.png)

Resetting the password, we are able to login as the administrator with our own new password.
Entering the password with the captured login, we are able to login as the administrator:
