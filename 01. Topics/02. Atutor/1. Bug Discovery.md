## Feel For Application
Beginning the analysis for atutor, we see that it is fairly easy to identify all publicly accessible ATutor webpages.
The following line is present in all publiclically accessible pages:
```php
$_user_location	= 'public';
```

Using publically accessible pages, we can find foothold and then begin the process of escallating our privileges.
We can find all publically accessible pages with the following query:

```sh
grep -rnw /var/www/html/ATutor -e "^.*user_location.*public.*" --color
```

Going through the results we find something interesting:

Looking at the code found in 
```path
/var/www/html/ATutor/mods/_standard/social/index_public.php
```

We can confirm that there's no authentication required and the page is accessible publically.

Studying the file:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss11.png)

We see that the code checks if the GET parameter 'q' is set, if it is, then the value is seemingly sanitised by getting passed to the addslashes function.
Immidiately after that, the new "sanitized" query variable is passed to the searchFriends function.

With this information, we can follow the call to the searchFriends function implementation.
We can look for the code that creates the searchFriends function, with the following grep command:
```sh
grep -rnw /var/www/html/ATutor -e "function searchFriends" --color
```

The result leads us to the following path:
```path
/var/www/html/ATutor/mods/_standard/social/lib/friends.inc.php
```

Reading the contents of the function defination:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss12.png)

We can see that _$addslashes_ appears again, indicating that we will likely have to deal with some sort of sanitization.
Our user-controlled $name variable is split into an array called $sub_names using a space as the separator, and it is looped through.

Reading the code further: 

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss13.png)

we find that on each iteration, the _$piece_ variable is being concatenated into a string containing a SQL _LIKE_ keyword.
finally, our semi-controlled _$match_piece_ variable is incorporated into the partial SQL query defined by the query variable.

Furthermore:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss14.png)

The $query variable is again concatenated to the $sql variable to form the final SQL query which is subsequently passed to _queryDB()_ function.
The querydb function finally executes the query against the database.

Even though the sanitization occurs twice, passing a single quote to the "q" parameter of the get request, we notice something interesting:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss15.png)

We get an error.
To inspect this further, we lead ourselves to the friends.inc.php file on line 350:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss16.png)

Line 350 uses the _$row_members_ variable, which should be populated with the results of the query executed on line 347
We can inspect the query from the mysql log file to see what's going wrong.
The query in the long file is as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM AT_members M WHERE (first_name LIKE '%'%'  OR second_name LIKE '%'%'  OR last_name LIKE '%'%'  OR login LIKE '%'%'  )
```

We notice that the single quote part of our payload was not escaped correctly by the application.
Moreover, from the logged query, it appears that we have not just one, but four different injection points.
No error occurs if we put double quotes meaning that the sql query is being formed correctly.

We could use UNION queries to dump the database, however, in this case, if we go back and look at the code in index_public.php, we can see that the results of the vulnerable query are actually _not_ displayed to the user.

On line 48, the query result set is used in a foreach loop that passes the retrieved _$member_id_ on to the _printSocialName_ function:

![](../../03.%20Screenshots/t1-ss17.png)

The results of this function call are then displayed to the end-user using the PHP echo function.
In other words, the results of the payload we inject are not directly reflected back to us, so a traditional union query will not be helpful here. We can verify this by continuing to follow this code execution path.

The _printSocialName_ function passes the $member_id value to the _get_display_name_ function defined in vital_funcs.inc.php in the following line:
```php
$str .= AT_print(get_display_name($id), 'members.full_name');
```

Then, _get_display_name_ prepares and executes the final query using the passed _$member_id_ parameter. The results of the query are then returned back to the caller in the following line:
```php
$sql = "SELECT login, first_name, second_name, last_name FROM %smembers WHERE member_id='%d'";

$row = queryDB($sql, array(TABLE_PREFIX, $id), TRUE);
```

This execution logic effectively prevents us from using any UNION payload into the original vulnerable query and turns this SQL injection into a classical blind injection.
